# Directly on Patreon
The most direct way to show your support is with your hard-earned monies, Canadian Tire Money or otherwise. Podcasting takes time, effort, and plenty of blood and guts. Your dollar goes a long way toward helping us keep doing what we do.

Plus it literally pays the bills.

# The Free Way

No, not like the road. Like the way you graciously give your time in an effort to help other people find the show! Then again, time = money. So technically you gave us free money?
