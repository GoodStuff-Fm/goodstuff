# Directly on Patreon
The most direct way to show your support is with your hard-earned monies, Canadian Tire Money or otherwise. Podcasting takes time, effort, and plenty of blood and guts. Your dollar goes a long way toward helping us keep doing what we do.

Plus it literally pays the bills.

<a href="https://www.patreon.com/bePatron?u=2327156" data-patreon-widget-type="become-patron-button">Become a Patron!</a><script async src="https://c6.patreon.com/becomePatronButton.bundle.js"></script>

Support the [Goodstuff Patreon campaign](https://www.patreon.com/goodstuff) and help the network grow. If you're also a podcaster, you can join at the [Club Castaway level](https://castaways.club/) to get access to support and community with fellow podcasters.


### Support Shows / Creators Directly

You can also support podcasts directly at their individual Patreon campaigns:

# The Free Way

[Write an Apple Podcasts Review →](https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/goodstuff-fm/id843385597?mt=2)
No, not like the road. Like the way you graciously give your time in an effort to help other people find the show! Then again, time = money. So technically you gave us free money?
