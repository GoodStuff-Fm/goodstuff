In this episode Paul incorrectly identified the song “I Am Superman” as being originally by REM. REM’s version was also a cover, and song is actually by The Clique. He also incorrectly identified “I’d Love to Change the World” as being originally by Jetta, but THAT was a cover of the original by Ten Years After. My mistake!
