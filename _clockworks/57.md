episode: '57'
description: |-
  This is the last episode of Legion. In this episode Charles and David have a showdown against Farouk and Farouk and ... it does not end exactly how you might expect.

  I hope you enjoy this episode of Clockworks! We'll be back for two more episodes, one reflecting on the third season, and one reflecting on the whole series.

  Until then, be a good boy (or girl).
