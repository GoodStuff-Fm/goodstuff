Thank you so much for being with us as we think and talk more than is necessary about Legion. If you've liked this podcast and you'd like us to make another podcast in the future you can encourage us to do it by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/clockworkscast">supporting us on Patreon</a>!

We have another podcast, Way Too Seriously, that is a critical analysis of kids' movies. If you want more of us, find us there and listen to the back episodes!

Paul has started an online school. As if this writing he's teaching courses on Frankenstein, Dracula, Medieval Werewolves, and Beowulf. There is a Zombies course in the works, and more being planned. If that sounds interesting to you, check it out at <a href="https://clockworksacademy.com/">Clockworks Academy</a>!

Finally, even though Clockworks: A Legion Podcast is officially over, weâ€™d still love to hear from you! You can always email us at clockworks cast at gmail.com, and find us <a href="https://twitter.com/clockworkscast">on twitter</a>. You might also want to find us at our individual twitter accounts.
