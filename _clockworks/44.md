We talked about volume 1 last year, it was was Clockworks episode 23, and we talked about volume 2 two weeks ago in Clockworks episode 43.

X-Men Legacy: Legion Vol 3 is subtitled “Revenants,” it’s made up of issues 13-18, and you can find it [here](https://comicstore.marvel.com/X-Men-Legacy-Legion-Vol-3-Revenants/digital-comic/33683) or by googling it.
