description: In this episode of Clockworks Paul and Jan let their feelings run away
  with them and gush about their favourite episodes, characters, performances, directors,
  writers, musical numbers, manifestations of the Shadow King, and moments of season
  1 of Legion. We also spend a little time pondering the unanswered questions of season
  1, and make our predictions and wild speculations about the future of Legion.
