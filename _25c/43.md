# Apple Corner 

- [Castlevania: Grimoire of Souls](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/castlevania-grimoire-of-souls/id1552347138)
    - Small amounts of action platformer trapped in character/item upgrade menu system
    - Auto attack makes game more accessible
    - This was an IAP powered Android game launched in 2019
    - Worked well with controller
- [The Oregon Trail](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/the-oregon-trail/id1502228492)
    - Getting back into it. Many game updates (about 20 onboarding screens!): new trails (California, Mormon), fishing mini game, more story quests (eg bring nitroglycerin to mine without blowing up), more challenges ("contracts" to complete a trail segment with added difficulty)
    - Menus work with controller okay, but definitely touch first
- [Galaga Wars+](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/galaga-wars/id1574668118)
    - Never played previous release
    - Weird hold to unpause mechanic, bad RSI scenario
    - Fun progression, pretty high difficulty
- [Netflix Games](https://about.netflix.com/en/news/let-the-games-begin-a-new-way-to-experience-entertainment-on-mobile)
    - First on Android, [now](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/11/09/netflix-games-ios-launch/) on iOS
