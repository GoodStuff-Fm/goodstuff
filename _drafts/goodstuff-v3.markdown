Is this thing on? Hello world?

Welcome to Goodstuff.fm, version 3.0!

We're excited to finally be able to unveil what has been months of work - not literally months of work but time spent during evenings and weekends around our regular work jobs - moving Goodstuff to our own home-grown CMS of sorts based on [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com) and [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com). Which, along with MP3 hosting by [Feed.Press](https://feed.press) is enabling us to run Goodstuff lean while we grow, one listener at a time.
