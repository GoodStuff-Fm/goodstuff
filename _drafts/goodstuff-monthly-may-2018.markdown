Hey there 👋🏻 It's been a while since we've put together a snapshot of our stats for the month. Almost a year, in fact. So in the interest of improved transparency here at Goodstuff, here are our numbers for May 2018 - patrons, listeners, site visitors, and anything else you'd like to know:

(*A little fine print: We're not going to be obsessively re-checking these numbers so forgive us if we they don't always balance exactly. We're podcasters, not accountants!*)

# Numbers for May 2018

## Expenses for the Month
* $20/mo for [Siteleaf](https://www.siteleaf.com/)
* $35/mo or $420/yr for [Transistor](https://transistor.fm/)
* $8.25/mo or $99/yr for domain management

A quick note about our expenses: In 2017, we moved to Jekyll and Siteleaf to manage the network. This means we also moved hosting to Github pages to take advantage of their free hosting for static sites. This year we've also moved hosting providers from our friends at FeedPress to a new service called Transistor. We're excited to work with Justin and Jon and to integrate their CMS with our site.
