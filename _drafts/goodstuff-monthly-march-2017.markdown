As part of our relaunch we thought we'd be a little more public with things podcasters often tend to be a little shy about sharing: numbers and stats.

At the start of each month we'll tell you how Goodstuff is doing - number of patrons, listeners, site visitors, and anything else you'd like to know.

(*A little fine print: We're not going to be obsessively re-checking these numbers so forgive us if we they don't always balance exactly. We're podcasters, not accountants!*)

# Numbers for March, 2017

## Expenses for the Month
* $55 for web and file hosting

## Patreon Campaigns

## Site Stats
* We borked our analytics code by mistake so data is missing from March.
* In the past: top traffic sources: [atu2.com](http://atu2.com), direct, organic search

## Feed Stats

* [atU2](/atu2/) holds the top spot for most subscribers
