<p>Memphis Meats has announced that it has now made what it claims to be the first animal-free, lab-grown pieces of chicken and duck. The resulting chunks of alterna-flesh have so far been crafted into two dishes: a coated and fried chicken strip, and a plateful of duck à l’orange. Memphis Meats says that it can produce a pound of its animal-free chicken for $9,000. That’s less than half what its beef cost just over a year ago.</p>

More than 4.3 million voters from 146 countries weighed in on which tokens they wanted to see in future versions of the game.</p>
