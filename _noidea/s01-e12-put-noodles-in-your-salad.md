  * Chaser

  > Why do Hollywood elitists continue to publicly humiliate themselves on twitter? Chernobyl was a failure of socialism (where the govt controls the means of production), the exact opposite of the Trump deregulation and tax cut agenda.

  * “Stephen King Likens 'Chernobyl' to Trump, Ignores Socialism”
  * “HBO's 'Chernobyl' Indicts Soviet Socialism. Reviews Downplay It”
  * “HBO’s ‘Chernobyl’ Gives Voice To Ordinary Soviets’ Horror Of Socialism”
  * “Conservatives Love HBO’s ‘Chernobyl,’ But Socialists Don’t Want To Talk About It”
* The Boy Who Cried Socialism
  * Posit: if your political strategy is based on avoiding being called “socialist” you’re doing it wrong
  * Also l posit: millenials and zoomers have had the bad guys calling everything socialism for so long we just learned to dismiss that bullschwa

### The C-Word
* Concentration Camps
  * Republicans are trying to weaponize political correctness against a correct and entirely accurate description of immigration practices.
  * Mostly it's to distract us from actually putting a stop to it. Instead we just talk about what the right term is.
  * Maybe they'd prefer if we called them ghettos?

### So Much for 'Hope And Change'
* [Biden Tells Elite Donors He Doesn't Want to ‘Demonize’ the Rich](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2019-06-19/biden-tells-elite-donors-he-doesn-t-want-to-demonize-the-rich)

### Cryptocurrency Announcement
* WoolooCoin has been acquired by Facebook
  * It will be sunset effective immediately
  * All WoolooCoins are now worthless
  * [Facebook announces Libra cryptocurrency and Calibra digital wallet - VentureBeat](https://venturebeat.com/2019/06/18/facebook-announces-libra-cryptocurrency-and-calibra-digital-wallet/)

    > Trust is vital, Carlson said, because you will have to not only trust Facebook to keep your social data safe, you’re going to have to trust it to be hack-free. If someone hacks your account, they could steal your cryptocurrency. That’s a somewhat common occurrence these days, so Facebook will have to be extremely disciplined to make sure it doesn’t happen.
