        > French police should be able to spy on suspects by remotely activating the camera, microphone and GPS of their phones and other devices, lawmakers agreed late on Wednesday, July 5. Part of a wider justice reform bill, the spying provision has been attacked by both the left and rights defenders as an authoritarian snoopers' charter, though Justice Minister Éric Dupond-Moretti insists it would affect only "dozens of cases a year.”
        
        "We're far away from the totalitarianism of 1984," George Orwell's novel about a society under total surveillance, Dupond-Moretti said. "People's lives will be saved" by the law, he added.

- Syphilis is making a comeback
    - [Antibiotic Shortage Could Fuel Rise in Syphilis Rates - The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/07/07/health/syphilis-epidemic-antibiotic-shortage-pfizer.html)
        - On the rise
            
            > Syphilis has been on the rise in the United States since 2000, reaching 176,713 cases in 2021, which was an increase of nearly 75 percent since 2017, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
            > 
            
            > Congenital syphilis tripled during that four-year period, to 2,855 cases, including 220 stillbirths or infant deaths. Rates are highest among the infants of Native American, Native Hawaiian, Pacific Islander and Black mothers.
            > 
        - Shortage
            
            > A new shortage of a type of penicillin crucial to the fight against syphilis is alarming infectious disease experts[.]…The shortage, announced by the drugmaker Pfizer in a letter last month, involves Bicillin L-A, a long-acting injectable antibiotic also known as penicillin G benzathine. The company cited significant increases in demand because of the rising rate of syphilis infections, as well as Bicillin’s recent use as an alternative to amoxicillin, another antibiotic that has periodically been scarce and is prescribed for more general infections like strep throat.
            > 
        - Why’s it happening?
            
            > David Harvey, executive director of the National Coalition of S.T.D. Directors, a trade association for public health associations, said rates of syphilis, chlamydia and gonorrhea are all surging “in part due to a public health landscape that is stretched dangerously thin, resulting in a lack of S.T.I. prevention, testing, and treatment.” He and others criticized Pfizer for inadequate production of the drug given the decades-long rising trajectory of syphilis infections. … 
            
            Mr. Harvey also denounced the Biden administration for agreeing in the debt ceiling deal to slash $400 million from the C.D.C.’s budget for S.T.I. prevention.

            > “Here’s a prime example of why leaving public health to the free market can be disastrous,” Tim Horn, director of medication access at the National Alliance of State and Territorial AIDS Directors, an advocacy group, said in an email.
            > 
            > 
            > “Since 2013, the price of Bicillin L-A has increased an astonishing 275 percent,” Mr. Horn said.

        > Over the past decade, “there’s been about a 700% increase in the cases of congenital syphilis in the United States,” said Dr. Robert McDonald of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Division of STD Prevention, Surveillance and Data Management.
        > 
        > 
        > “It really is upsetting, because this is something that is fully preventable if we have the right screening and treatment,” he said. “It’s out there; people just need to be connected with that.”
        > 
        > Rates of congenital syphilis, meaning the number of cases for every 100,000 live births, are highest in the South and Southwest, in states such as Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas, according to a CNN analysis of CDC data. 
        > 
        
        > This is a frustrating reversal for the US, where determined public health efforts and robust contact-tracing programs had driven congenital syphilis cases to almost historically low numbers just a decade ago.
        > 
        > 
        > In 2012, 324 congenital syphilis cases were reported to the CDC. In 2021, that number had ballooned to 2,677.

    > Yet the data is overwhelmed by a particular blend of internet-fueled ideologies known as “[conspirituality](https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/conspirituality-wellness-world-red-pilled-1234770419/).” This is where quack pseudoscience meets quasi-religious beliefs about how our bodies work, and suspicion of any chemical substance (whether in vaccines, pills, or lotions) is addressed by the pre-modern wisdom of the ages. Such influencers not only encourage you to think of the sun as exclusively nourishing and sustaining, like a benevolent god, but also tell you that sunblock inhibits your production of vitamin D, even though the [evidence](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30945275/) indicates a [negligible effect](https://www.health.harvard.edu/staying-healthy/6-things-you-should-know-about-vitamin-d#:~:text=Sunscreen%20prevents%20sunburn%20by%20blocking,might%20not%20be%20that%20important.) on this process.
