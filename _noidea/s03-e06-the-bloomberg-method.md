  * The Bloomberg Method
* Jake Paul Financial Freedom

  > Paul, who dropped out of high school and completed his degree online, told Variety financial freedom, to him, means luxuries like travel and partying.

  "And at the end of the day, it kind of ties back to if I want to throw a party, why not?" he said.

      > Sanders, pummeled during the day for his refusal to produce once-promised medical records and his spokeswoman’s false accusation that Bloomberg had suffered heart attacks, needed to show he had responses to legitimate concerns about his health. He didn’t. He simply reiterated that he had put out letters, not his complete health record. He yelled through much of the debate, insisting his Medicare-for-all proposal would not force Nevada’s Culinary Union (which opposes Sanders’s proposal) to give up its health-care plan. He also went full-on socialist, telling Bloomberg he shouldn’t have been allowed to earn his billions.
