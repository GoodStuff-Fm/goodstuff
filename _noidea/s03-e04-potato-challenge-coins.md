* Aaron's Dream
  * Dreamt I was meeting a candidate for congress in my district, Chris Bubser
  * She asked if she could have my vote and all the sudden I had an epiphany. I said, "No. I only vote for people who have a working class background, or who have proved over a long period of time they have class consciousness and put working class and the poor first."
  * She's a carpet-bagger wealthy person. Would it be good to have a democrat flip our district blue? Yes. Does she have better resources than our previous dem candidates? Yes. But what's the point?
* Vote Blue No Matter Who

  > The Google Maps listing for Effingham County High School in Springfield, Georgia, has some relevant information, like the main office phone number and the link to the school website. But the photo gallery section is a little off-topic. Instead of showing photos of the school, which Google Maps would normally display, there are nonsensical photos, like the Nintendo character Kirby drawn with legs and feet, a Joker meme, a Sad Kermit meme, a Minecraft screenshot, and erotic fan art showing characters from the education website BrainPop.

  > People searching for Effingham County High School will find zero photos of the high school’s exterior. However, they’ll be able to glimpse the school’s interior life.
