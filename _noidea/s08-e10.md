        > Earlier that same day, Macron retaliated by politicizing this succession of tragedies himself. During the Council of Ministers, the president said the recent events are not all of the same nature, but then had much more general words about the evolution of society. "We must be intractable on the substance. No violence is legitimate, whether it is verbal or against people. We must work in depth to counter this process of decivilization," said Macron, in comments first reported by Le Parisien and confirmed to Le Monde.
        > 
        
        > Far from being a coincidence, this analysis was echoed a few minutes later by government spokesman Olivier Véran, when asked about the death of the nurse in Reims. "Let's ask ourselves about a society in which the people who care, the people who wear the scrubs, the people who devote their days, their nights, to preserving the health of others are threatened. There is not even that limit anymore," he said.

- [Inspire, Enable, Empower](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgebradt/2023/05/30/how-to-make-remote-workers-want-to-come-to-the-office/)
    - We’re not looking for compliance, we’re looking for subjugation of the will
        
        > Making remote workers want to come to the office is all about altering their balance of consequences. If you do this by punishing them for not coming to the office, the best you’ll ever get is compliance. Instead, inspire, enable and empower them to co-create a culture and office experience they want to be part of.

    - Leadership
        
        > Cubas hires, develops and exits for leadership.
        > 
        
        I have no idea how to parse this sentence. It’s like, instead of words coming out of somebody’s mouth, it’s an opaque mist of beige.
        
        > Everyone’s a leader.
        > 
        
        So they are paid like they are, right? Right?
        
        > Our discussion took place at a Cornerstone International Group conference in Miami. Cornerstone is an alliance of independent firms engaged in the search, selection, evaluation and development of talent. They share information, leads and tools across their offices around the world. About fifty people attended the conference.
        > 
        
        There were TENS of people!
        
    - Purpose
        
        > They use a purpose instead of a mission because Cubas thinks missions are a little too confining while a purpose, and their purpose in particular, is more transcendent. It’s not worth digging into that argument here because if that’s what Cubas and his team think, it’s the right choice for Cubas and his team.
        > 
        
        ‘I’m not going to explain this because that would be extremely disrespectful to the God-King Cubas’
        
    - Values
        
        > Spending just a couple of days with the Cornerstone Peru leaders that came to the conference, listening to their presentations, watching them engage with each other and with others made it impossible not to be impressed and inspired. They say and really do define and live their values all the time to make their organization one in which they would like to work. They teach each other and others through their examples. They walk the talk. They openly celebrate their winning culture.
        > 
        
        Word salad. 82 words and I have no idea what was actually occurring here.
        
        > Cubas himself leads with his presence. He shows up, physically getting on planes to spend good time with his people in Peru, Mexico, Panama and Miami. He says “The only way to generate trust is through face-to-face meetings.” He meets with his people in the offices. He works with them and their clients in their clients’ offices. They spend time together over meals after work.
        > 
        
        So brave.
        
    - Implications
        
        > You can alter the balance of consequences by adjusting positive or negative consequences of desired or undesired behaviors.
