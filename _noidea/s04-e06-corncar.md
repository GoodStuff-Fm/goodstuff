    - A special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), sometimes called blank-check company, is a shell company that has no operations but plans to go public with the intention of acquiring or merging with a company with the proceeds of the SPAC's initial public offering (IPO). SPACs allow retail investors to invest in private equity type transactions, particularly leveraged buyouts.
