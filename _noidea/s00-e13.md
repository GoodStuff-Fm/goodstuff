- 9/11
- What happened
- Andrew's Unified Theory
    - America peaked with the moon landings in 1969 and the 1970s
    - Since then, America has been in a period of decline
    - This decline became terminal, and everybody made aware of it, on September 11, 2001
    - The 20th century ended on 9/11
- Why is everything shit?
- It didnâ€™t used to be this way
- What can we do about it?
    - It all comes back to solidarity
    - The David Graeber quote
