- Ad: The Obama Foundation
    - At the Obama Foundation, we strive to redirect workers’ fury away from labor action or protest and into productive action such as Social Media Influencing, GOTV, & raising awareness through mobilizing awareness.

- RBG: Nothing matters
    - No outcome of a fight to hold the seat open, no outcome of the election, will materially affect the most serious threat to our future: climate change
    - Tactical framing has poisoned our minds
    - We could talk about what the Democrats could do to try to win this election, or how they will likely win power eventually, but none of it will matter, because neither party is paying any attention to the oncoming catastrophe
    - Climate change is still seen as a long-term threat. But it's near term.
    - Also: why focusing on RGB is detrimental.
        - The parasocial trap is real: it makes you feel more emotionally connected to a Supreme Court justice than the actual people living next door to you; than the workers delivering your door dash; than the millions of people suffering under capitalism.

- The fires
    - Callback to [S01E01](https://goodstuff.network/noidea/1) where Dianne Fienstein turned away sunrise movement kids

    - The cause of the fires is not climate change or forest management.
        - The cause is our economic, political, and social system which is based on the lie that we can rob, kill, and consume without consequence.
        - Capitalism relies on a fiction that must not ever be question lest the true fragility of it be revealed— that we are eating our children’s bread, sucking away their air, and filling their world with refuse and waste.
        - Capitalism relies on a refusal to consider the harm and violence we do to others in order to maintain our lifestyle.
        - How can we be surprised that it would lead to this? It’s as if we have left a giant pile of all of gasoline-soaked rags out back and cannot understand how we burned our garage down.
    - This is why voting is so important. We must vote climate change out of office once and for all /s
