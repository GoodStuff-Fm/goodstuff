- @jack on Trump's Twitter Ban and uh also bitcoin

    [https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510775426019328](https://twitter.com/jack/status/1349510775426019328)

- Are we headed towards a society where everyone‚Äôs mad all the time?
    - Folks, you gotta give people grace.
    - You have to let them make mistakes.
    - You need to understand that not everyone thinks or understands the same things as you, and you need to be able to gracefully deal with that.
    - Kill the cop inside your mind.
    - Again, most of this comes back to thinking of things in terms of individuals, but no level of bullying or coercing individuals will change a societal issue‚Äî these things have to be tackled at the points of power and influence that empower bad shit.
    - Forgive me for getting religious here, but Jesus on the cross didn‚Äôt look at his executioners and say, ‚Äúfather, destroy them for they know exactly what they‚Äôre doing‚Äù. You have got to believe that people err because of ignorance and if they actually *understood* their behavior would change. Most people are not willfully malicious and bad. People have so many problems they face every day. No need to create more stumbling blocks.
