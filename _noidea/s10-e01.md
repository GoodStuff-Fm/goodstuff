- We’re back and we’re influencers now
    - Andrew is a film photography influencer
    - Aaron is a fashion influencer
- This is all a construct
    - The constitution is a piece of paper
    - Judges are just some guys
    - The only thing that is real is power (seized or surrendered)
- Is this an omen?

- [Tuxedo Society](https://www.usermag.co/p/old-money-content-private-club-quiet-luxury-tuxedosociety-tiktok-instagram)

    > Over the weekend, a video went viral on X showing a bunch of 20 somethings dressed in black tie dining and dancing in what looks to be an old European villa with the caption “Casual parties at Lake Como.” The video amassed over 25.5 million views and sparked a day of discourse about whether the people in the video were actual old money or just cosplaying.
    >
    >
    > Like most things on the internet, the video was staged. The people in the video are all part of an “Instagram club” where you pay to [dress up and make “old money” content](https://x.com/LouisPisano/status/1885811408463376387) with a bunch of aspiring “old money” influencers. The club is called [the TuxedoSociety](https://www.tuxedosocietyinnercircle.com/) and it bills itself as an exclusive members only club "dedicated to the finest experiences in the most iconic places of all time."
    >
    > The website for TuxedoSociety, [which costs 6,000 euros per year to join](https://www.tuxedosocietyinnercircle.com/), promises that the group is “where legacy is crafted, and every encounter holds the promise of something greater, TuxedoSociety is your gateway to meaningful relationships and once in a lifetime moments.”
    >
    > There is no physical club, so members are just paying thousands of euros to get invited to “luxury adventures,” which they’ll have to pay extra for, and networking opportunities. They also promise to teach members, “The Gentleman's Way: Learn the art of Everyday Elegance, apporach [sic] life with the charm of a gentleman.”
    >
    > TuxedoSociety’s website is riddled with spelling errors and features the generic Wordpress logo at the top of the tab. One co-founder, Gabriele Bonini, is an e-commerce hustler, and the other, Riccardo Capotosti, is an “old money” Instagram and TikTok internet personality. All the members listed on the website are men, though attractive women are featured prominently in their content. And though it bills itself as exclusive, the co-founders are promoting membership on Instagram.
