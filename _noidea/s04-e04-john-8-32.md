        > This is a disgrace. But of course, I’m so inured to disgraces by now that I can hardly feel anything at all. What’s happening with baseball is a reflection of the rest of this broken nation’s response to the pandemic. Baseball, like America, believes its inherent specialness makes it exempt from the rules, even the ones governing human biology. It wants to be congratulated for putting in the absolute bare minimum of prevention measures and then for using those meager efforts as an excuse to justify all the horrible shit its negligence has wrought.

- The demoralizing surrender of giving up hope for anything better
    - When presenting people with some insane decision by an institution—the state, an employer, etc—the new response, particularly by conservatives and moderates, is to simply shrug and utter, "well, what're you gonna' do?"
    - The fact we've given up arguing over the actual facts and just relinquished all hopes that anything better is possible is devastating.
- Maybe we should just not?
