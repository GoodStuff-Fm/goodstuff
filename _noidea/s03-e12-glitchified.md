    - You can't protest the response to the pandemic while also wearing a mask and staying in your car. You're just revealing that you don't think you'll get it and you don't care if other people get it and die. You just need your lawn care supplies.

- Rationalizing Ethical Consumption
- “Democrats Should Abandon The Working Class”
    - [https://jacobinmag.com/2020/04/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-presidential-campaign/](https://jacobinmag.com/2020/04/bernie-sanders-elizabeth-warren-presidential-campaign/)

        > “The future of [Bernie’s] agenda lies with young people, but college-educated and suburban voters are increasingly interested in the progressive agenda,” Sean McElwee, co-founder of the left-wing polling outfit Data for Progress, tells me. “Sadly, we [progressives] are about four years behind in reaching out to those voters because people don’t read enough fucking polling data.”

        In other words, don't worry about the working class. Focus on the professional class.

    - This is a silly analysis—working class folks stand to benefit a lot more from the policies that Bernie supported than the professional class, *which is why the media was constantly trying to muddy the waters* about all these policy issues to make them seem infeasible or unrealistic.
    - What we have now is two parties essentially fighting over the same demographic slice of wealthy, privileged voters, while the underprivileged, poor, and underrepresented go completely ignored. Is this a politics you want to support?

        - Honestly, this seems like something we'd come up with.
    - Probably don't put too much stock in people who are constantly creating new orgs—it's really just a kind of grift.
        1. Create an org that donors can donate to for tax incentives on their part
        2. Do minimal work of any kind of advocacy (tweet, maybe write an op-ed)
        3. Accrue most of the donations to yourself
        4. Move on to found a new org about the next Pressing Issue
    - Data for Progress is beholden to its donors, just like every other think tank and polling firm.
- We're Going To Lose With This Kind Of Nonsense

    - Attacking Trump with Republican talking points isn't going to work. His voters don't care about hypocrisy, plus also we don't really need any of their votes to win! Focus on other demographics.

- FaceID in these troubling times
    - I miss the button

    - Alternately: add Touch ID back in and let me use either Face ID or Touch ID.
- FOURTEEN INCHES IS THE CORRECT SIZE
    - Of laptops, that is.
    - It's the Goldilocks Size.
    - I will not be taking further questions at this time.
