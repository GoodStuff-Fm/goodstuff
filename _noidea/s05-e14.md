    - Climate: too much carbon, my friends
        - [Rise of carbon dioxide unabated - Welcome to NOAA Research](https://research.noaa.gov/article/ArtMID/587/ArticleID/2636/Rise-of-carbon-dioxide-unabated)

            > “Progress in emissions reductions is not visible in the CO2 record,” said Pieter Tans, senior scientist with NOAA’s Global Monitoring Laboratory. ”We continue to commit our planet - for centuries or longer - to more global heating, sea level rise, and extreme weather events every year.” If humans were to suddenly stop emitting CO2, it would take thousands of years for our CO2 emissions so far to be absorbed into the deep ocean and atmospheric CO2 to return to pre-industrial levels.

    - Climate: also, too much methane?

            > New data showed both methane and carbon dioxide reached record amounts in the atmosphere last year, despite the coronavirus pandemic bringing much of the world’s economy to a halt.

            Lori Bruhwiler, physical scientist at the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, said the jump in methane levels was “fairly surprising — and disturbing”.

            “We don’t usually expect them to jump abruptly in a year,” said Bruhwiler. The exact reasons for the increase are not yet known, she added.

            Methane, which is 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide as a factor in global warning, comes from using fossil fuels such as coal and gas and from microbial sources in wetlands, cows and landfill.

            > One hypothesis for the increase in methane is a rise in emissions from biological sources such as wetlands, according to Nisbet.

            “Parts of the tropics have grown warmer and wetter” because of global warming, triggering the release of more methane, he said.

            Another hypothesis is that the atmosphere’s ability to “clean up” methane by breaking it down over time has declined.

            “A warming planet could be causing more natural emissions of methane,” said Durwood Zaelke, president of the Institute for Governance and Sustainable Development, an environmental charity based in Washington DC that focuses on shortlived climate pollutants such as methane.
