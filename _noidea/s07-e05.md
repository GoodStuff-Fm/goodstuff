- Lil Baby Howard is Mad His Children Are Organizing Against Him
    
    > Madison Hall, a 25-year-old barista and union organizer, says that the 68-year-old billionaire repeatedly bristled at and cut off their questions about Starbucks’ handling of the growing union movement within the company.
    “If you hate Starbucks so much, why don’t you go somewhere else?” Schultz told Hall, they recalled.
    > 
    
    ... 
    
    > Hall says that when they mentioned the several federal complaints filed by the NLRB against the company for illegally harassing and firing pro-union workers, a number of other baristas began murmuring, seemingly unaware of the charges. Hall says they tried to explain the NLRB’s actions, but was again cut off by Schultz. A challenge over whether Starbucks offered the best benefits in the retail industry was also interrupted. 
    
    “Then he went into a long rant about the history of Starbucks and how he used to be poor,” Hall reports.
    Hall says they pursued the line of questioning, only to encounter more hostility.
    
    “I said, ‘You say you’re not anti-union, but on July 1 2021, [Starbucks was] found guilty of retaliation in Philadelphia,’” Hall relays. “That was when he got super-defensive and cut me off, saying ‘We’re not talking about this.’
