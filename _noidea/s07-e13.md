    - Keep Europe’s War On Cars Out Of America
        - [https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianafurchtgott-roth/2022/07/25/keep-europes-war-against-cars-out-of-america/?sh=400f1fca234c](https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianafurchtgott-roth/2022/07/25/keep-europes-war-against-cars-out-of-america/?sh=400f1fca234c)
        
        > Cities are being hollowed out by pedestrian precincts, with commerce for residents moving outside the centers of town, leaving the quaint city streets for tourists. Locals need not visit.
        > 
        
        > American transportation policy is mistakenly copying Europe, and it’s not only the higher gas prices and smaller planned electric vehicles. Bike lanes are proliferating and parking spaces vanishing.
        > 
        
        > Most disturbingly, the European war against cars meets little if any organized resistance. Where failing to adhere to environmental catechisms is a public sin, Europe slouches towards a dystopian society in which owning or using a large non-electric car—one of the greatest social inventions of the 20th
         century—is subject to public scorn.
