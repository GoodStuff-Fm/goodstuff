* Dummy Chum and Nut-picking
  * Dummy Chum: events, propaganda, memes, or messages that activate the stupidest ranks within any given group/movement/fanbase

    * Ex:// sharing a post of a fringe BLM activist who states that it's racist to speak to white people and holding it up as representative of the views of the entire movement.
