[Ask Polly: My In-Laws Are Careless About My Food Allergy!](https://www.thecut.com/2019/08/ask-polly-my-in-laws-are-careless-about-my-food-allergy.html)

> I have a very severe allergy to mushrooms. I carry an EpiPen, and I have been hospitalized multiple times because of exposure to this food. One time, I began convulsing in the ambulance on the way to the hospital. My husband politely explained this to his parents when we started dating, and I was invited to family meals.
>
> Since then, most meals we have shared at my in-laws’ house have had very limited options for me. Somehow, they manage to find a way to add mushrooms to almost everything. One time, they made a point to make a special plate of mushrooms and pass it around. My mother-in-law said, very rudely, “I would’ve liked to add mushrooms directly to the salad, but SOMEBODY has problems with it!” They even added mushroom powder to the mashed potatoes at one holiday dinner. My mother-in-law claimed it was a new recipe she’d found.

**E-Folks**

> If this is all new to you, here's an e-boy primer, starting with how they look: their hair is styled like Leonardo DiCaprio's as Baz Luhrmann's Romeo, via Michael Pitt in The Dreamers. They smoke cigarettes, sometimes, for the aesthetic, but they're as sober as an AA counsellor. They've been raised on Mac Demarco, The 1975 and lo-fi terrorcore-era Tyler, the Creator, but also Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. Their vibe is the climax of all those faintly related spheres, filtered through Brockhampton's brightly-coloured, post-One Direction world.
>
> Clothes-wise: loads of chains. Bicycle chains, jean chains, wallet chains, coke can ring chains. They put padlocks around their necks. You could describe them as classic Camden Lock goth, were it not for the fact they seem like remarkably well-kept, happy – if a little performatively sad – young men, many of them seemingly being readied for a future in which their college tuition will be paid in full. ([What Is an E-Boy? - Vice](https://www.vice.com/en_uk/article/gy44jj/what-is-an-e-boy))

> That's another trait of the e-boy: being generally gross. It's something they've cribbed from Billie Eilish, queen of the e-boys (and their female counterparts, e-girls, who i-D wrote about [here](https://i-d.vice.com/en_uk/article/vb99em/tik-tok-beauty-standards-e-girl-make-up)). But alongside that grossness, they also rival 2007 Myspace kids in the pouting stakes. It's a fine line, really: a load of posturing to show everyone how beautiful they are, with just enough purposefully manky stuff to remind their audience they really don't care about looks.

Yes.

**An Efficiency Thought Technology**

* When you double efficiency your halve efficacy.
  * Efficiency masks other failings because it gets adopted as the supreme metric. Once you pull back the curtain, you can see that making efficiency your god usually distracts you from more mundane but crucial areas of focus.
  * EX:// Infrastructure
    * Algorithmic systems which predict the most efficient areas for road improvements cause people to stop paying attention to the maintenance of less efficient areas, which become degraded and require_more_ work than if they had simply been maintained.
