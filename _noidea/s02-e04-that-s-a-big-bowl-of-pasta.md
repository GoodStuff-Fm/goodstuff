**Calendar Capitalism**

> In 1984, President Ronald Reagan declared ice cream a “nutritious and wholesome food” to help the dairy industry, since he was already trying to find a way to get rid of a surplus of 500 million pounds of cheese. In the years since, sales of ice cream have spiked on this day. Dippin’ Dots, Cold Stone Creamery, and Baskin-Robbins ran promotions and in-store giveaways on National Ice Cream Day 2019, as did PetSmart and Williams Sonoma. Halo Top gave out vouchers in a promotional collaboration with Bumble. Yes, some Americans are likely now using a dating app because Ronald Reagan had too much cheese .

**Actually, We Can't: The Humiliating Weakness of Neoliberal Policy Worship**

* Posit: policies are great, but without power they're meaningless.


* All political movements which prioritize policy at the expense of, or without commensurate focus on obtaining the power necessary to enact an agenda will always fail.
* [Matt Bruenig’s case for single-payer health care - The Ezra Klein Show](https://overcast.fm/+QLhXxQkq0)
* One of the argument Ezra makes against pure, unadulterated M4A appears to be as follows:
  * We cannot afford to risk failed attempts at bold policy because it results in disillusioned voters
    * As if failing to try is not equally or more discouraging and disillusioning
    * Voters want representatives that fight for them
    * The incentive is a fear of losing power when it should be a fear of wasting power.
    * The policy is secondary to the movement behind it. 
    * There's just always this underlying but unspoken assumption that the status-quo is tolerable while we wait. And it's curiously always coming from people for whom the status quo is, like, not killing them and their family.
