    - Takeaways
        - The Ascendent America theory proved false
            - Look at the number of black and brown and non-republican allegiant reactionaries at this demonstration yesterday.
            - Hope in the inevitable victory of democrats via demographic shifts is naive and dangerous
            - Checking in on the clinton dems I know that are now MAGA confirms that Trumpism has absorbed a lot of democrats
        - If we're going to curb this fascism, we have to materially improve peoples' lives
            - Looking at the videos and posts of the people involved in this riot, you find a thread of common outlook: the state of our cities and states is in shambles.
                - They talk about all the homelessness, the drug epidemics, the suicides, the joblessness, the hopelessnessâ€”- these are working class concerns
            - If the prospects for your life and the life of your children only looks to be getting perpetually worse, it's extremely unlikely you'll be persuaded by decency or morals or ethics.
            - We have to improve peoples' material lives and make a better world.
            - Biden admin shows no signs of doing this because you have to change underpinning systems
        - [A return to civility will not begin to quell the threat of fascism in the US](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2021/jan/08/threat-fascism-us-storming-capitol-far-right-trump)

            > Fascism does not arrive on the scene with full uniform and programme. The Jewish socialist Arthur Rosenberg traced the origins of fascism as a mass movement to the period before the first world war, when millions were already infected by volkisch, racial-nationalist ideology, and by contempt for democratic government. It consolidates through experimentation, learning the ropes through episodes that, at first, appear amateurish and thuggish, from the beer hall (Munich) putsch to the demolition of the Babri Masjid. First as farce, then as tragedy.

            - The absurdity and chaos is a feature, not a bug

            > Trumpism is not an aberration, but a mass phenomenon. Trump greatly expanded his base between 2016 and 2020, adding more than 10 million votes to its total. He expanded into places and demographic constituencies thought to be closed to him. No other Republican presidential candidate could have done this. And it was achieved precisely through the same means that led to the spectacle in the Capitol. To hope that Joe Biden can defuse this by restoring civility and bipartisanship to Washington would be unforgivably complacent.

- Recontextualize, or Please sir, may I have some context
    - So much bad discourse happens simply because somebody pops off without any context.
    - Modern social media makes this even more difficult. It tries to decontextualize everything.
- Conclusion: More People Need Hobbies
    - Pick up a football
- Burger King Rebrand
