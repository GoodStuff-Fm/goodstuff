### Contempt vs. Solidarity

* ["What Iâ€™ve Learned From People Whose Loved Ones Were Transformed by Fox News" NY Mag](http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2019/04/i-gathered-stories-of-people-transformed-by-fox-news.html)
* Q:// How do you effectively pull loved ones away from this kind of thing?
* Q:// Is there a way to counteract this using similar tactics?
* Q:// How might we see similar things taking place among our generation? How can we recognize it and avoid it before it becomes a similar behemoth?
* Q:// Latent racism does explain why certain groups were so vulnerable to foxâ€™s graft, but do any other factors explain it? What about financial instability? What about widespread corruption? Could addressing those issues have mitigated foxâ€™s power?
* Refuse to do to Zoomers what Boomers did to Millennials

### If youâ€™re in debt, you donâ€™t deserve a vacation

* [Should I take a summer vacation if I'm in debt? - The Washington Post](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2019/04/25/no-if-youre-debt-you-dont-deserve-vacation/?utm_term=.0d926b2016be)
  * This seems to be part of a pattern of "personal finance" people who have disdain for people who get into debt
  * Their advice is always to not have debt, ignoring why that isn't feasible in a lot of cases
  * Also, they don't really think about _why_ we as a nation have so much debt, beyond the surface level of "people buy too much stuff".
  * Could there be deeper structural reasons to do with capitalism? ðŸ¤”

### De-contemptifying

* Any time I bristle at somebody "having it easy" or being "spoiled" I stop and ask myself, "is this actually just a decent and good thing for them that I'm only upset about because I've internalized a rationalization of late capitalisms awfulness by telling myself it was, basically, vitamins for character that was good for me?"

> Anyone following the labor movement today could be forgiven for thinking itâ€™s one-dimensional. The museums are unionizing. The academics are unionizing. The media is unionizing. The political workers and nonprofit workers and tech workers are unionizing. Has organized labor become white collar? Not at all. We all wear the same collar. Itâ€™s called CAPITALISM.
