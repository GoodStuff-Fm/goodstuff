    - Soy chorizo (it‚Äôs good. Chorizo is just a spice and texture delivery vehicle)
    - Eggs
    - Cheese
    - Serve atop hash browns

- Terfs mad

    - This stuff mostly doesn't play in the US, at least compared to how outrageously popular transphobia is in the UK.
    - This is not to say that there still aren't incredible barriers and hurdles for trans people in the US.
    - We stan Gerald Stratford, the only unproblematic Brit, because he found a hobby instead of tweeting about gender.
- The Daily Mess
    - Should we try our own version of the Mountain Eagle letters? Here's some from the local rag
        - Critical thinking

            > It appears that many of the people submitting letters to the editor seriously need to take a critical thinking class and use it. Critical thinking is an absolute necessity in this day and age.

            James Windhausen, Hesperia

        - It has started

            > Big tech has violated our right to free speech. Not only the president‚Äôs, others too. It‚Äôs going to be a dark future for our country because Georgia sold out our country for a lousy, $2,000 check.
            Already the D.C. mayor is calling for statehood. This is the woman who allowed BLM to set fire to buildings and beat those who were guarding the White House until they were all bloody. I saw it, but some of you didn‚Äôt because the mainstream media edits it out just like they edit out Trump condemning all the white racists. It‚Äôs the video Biden used over and over to call Trump a racist, and it was all a lie!

            We need to take 230 protection away from these tech companies. The Senate was supposed to work on this but they are a bunch of cowards!

            Pelosi wants to impeach Trump (he has two weeks to go) because she wants to make sure he doesn‚Äôt run again. How sick is that?
            The New York governor is botching up vaccine distribution. It isn‚Äôt bad enough that he killed all the people in the nursing homes. He‚Äôs going to kill more by delaying the shots. It‚Äôs like having dumb and dumber in charge. I just hope our governor does a better job, but he has made too many mistakes or isn‚Äôt smart enough to do the job.
            Lets face it, these people have wasted billions and our country is trillions in debt, and our money will soon be worthless. There‚Äôs a good reason the American people are depressed. Our country has been going downhill since Obama was first elected president. He stated he could do a third term by proxy, so I guess he‚Äôs still lurking in the shadows.

            I don‚Äôt think that you will print this because our country has slid into an era of communism.

            Anita DeLeon, Barstow

        - African American

            > Kamala Harris is referred to as ‚ÄúAfrican-American.‚Äù I have always thought that the term ‚ÄúAfrican-American‚Äù referred to someone who has a parent of African descent, and one of American ancestry. Harris has roots in India and Jamaica. ‚ÄúAfrican-American‚Äù is a misnomer in this case. ‚ÄúWoman of Color‚Äù would seem more accurate.

            Ann Miner, Apple Valley

        - Goodbye, Marie Callender‚Äôs

            > I'm really going to miss those delicious pies. My wife and I enjoyed dining at Marie Callender‚Äôs. Their pot roast and turkey meals were always great. 

            Unfortunately, generational changes were its downfall. Younger generations viewed the restaurant chain as an ‚Äúold person‚Äôs‚Äù eating place.

            It was a beautiful building. They don't make them like that anymore. I'm sure the new Chick-fil-A replacing it will do just fine. Still going to miss those pies. 

            John Martin, Victorville

        - State of Our Nation

            > What does it say about the state of our nation today that we have to have thousands of National Guard troops in Washington to protect our incoming president from the followers of our outgoing president?

            Johnathan Haas, Apple Valley

        - Stinker Of The House

            > We have had good, well-intentioned speakers of the House in the past, such as Democrat Tip O'Neill, who worked with President Ronald Reagan to accomplish legislative action.
            We now have Nancy ‚ÄúPelousy,‚Äù who strived to undermine a conservative president from the day he entered office until his last day. She even tore up the state of the union speech paperwork, destroying government property.

            She is the seed of division and disunity, and will thwart any of Biden‚Äôs attempts for unity because of her disruptive management style that is so fickle. She doesn‚Äôt represent the people, just her own self interests. Hold onto your hats as she balks at Biden‚Äôs efforts only if Chuck Schumer ‚Äúcounsels‚Äù her.

            Irv Kettler, Victorville

- South Africa Variant: We Got some Bad News
    - [https://youtu.be/JlTxZ3shSzE](https://youtu.be/JlTxZ3shSzE)
        - Takeaways:
            1. Spike protein now has two points of connection to the ACE in lung cells
            2. This new point of contact *also* has the ability to adapt and shape-shift on the fly to become basically immune to treatments 
            3. The two points of connection effectively block antibodies
            4. They have observed re-infection of hospital workers and theorize this will be very common when this variant becomes widespread 
            5. Even if you stop the spread of this particular variant, studies are showing that this mutation is an inevitable development in the evolution of covid-19 and has been replicated in multiple labs. 
            6. Basically, this mutation makes the virus spread mega-fast and mega-easy and makes current treatments (regenerate etc) ineffective and those with antibodies from previous bouts of covid can become re-infected
        - What it‚Äôs going to take to stop this:
            - We have to vaccinate everyone in all countries to slow the spread down

- What if we start ironically stanning Biden? Like, as a bit?
    - Like how I cheered for the clippers as a kid because they were so bad
