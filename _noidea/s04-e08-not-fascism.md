- Stop Personifying The Year Challenge 2020
    - I'm going to taint punch the next person who says "I can't wait for this year to be over"
    - The problems we're experiencing are not momentary or novel—-they are systemic. Stop talking like they're just some sort of natural outcome of astrological alignments or some shit I WILL KICK YOU IN THE ANKLE!!!!

    - Leaders, pundits, posters and politicians get a large amount of credit for things they say without any examination of whether or not there’s any prior history to prove they’ll follow through with their Good Pronouncements ™
    - When presented with a fire hot take or a Very Brave Statement, temper it against the actual actions of the person.

    > Smith’s main grievance against unions is that organized labor is, in itself, a political act, something that institutions like the Times avoid like the plague lest someone accuse them of “bias.” Smith in particular picks at recent support for unions (including the one he had such doubts about at BuzzFeed) by popular progressive politicians like Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, as well as the NewsGuild’s request for public stimulus funding for recession-plagued journalists. To drive this point home, he quotes Peter Baker, the Times’ White House Correspondent who is so psychotically horny for objectivity that he *doesn’t even vote.* The thing that Smith and his boss Dean Baquet obstinately refuse to recognize is that sustaining the illusion of objectivity people like Baker clearly yank it to on a nightly basis is really only possible for people like Baker who work at institutions like the Times. The rest of us work in the real world, where bad-faith critics will always assume you’re biased no matter how many Midwestern rest-stop diners you interview. The only way to combat this is not through both-sidesing and hedging, but by being open and honest about biases in reporting and striving above all for fairness, not balance.

- Fascism is an ideology; not a system
- The Violence Discourse
    - The discourse on violence has become perverted and degenerate.
    - The discourse is governed by the elites and reflects their interests
    - Destruction of property = violence, but destruction of human bodies and minds = ??? "something else" every damn time
    - It's the same conflict with "cancel culture" — criticism of the powerful is violence, but criticism of the lower classes is *discourse*????
    - Especially topical given the murder of two protestors by a right-wing vigilante in Kenosha
        - Defending a gas station
            - Excited to get my Speedway SuperAmerica Defense Campaign Ribbon with Oak Leaf Cluster
        - Extremely ridiculous argument that the shooter was acting in "self-defense"—from people who were trying to stop him from SHOOTING MORE PEOPLE
        - Right-wing media doing its best to write hagiographies of the shooter
- Actually, protestors are the real lynchers
