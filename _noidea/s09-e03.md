- [Bosses are mad about sick days](https://www.wsj.com/lifestyle/workplace/bosses-have-a-problem-people-are-actually-using-sick-days-d45b5f9a?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email)
    
    > The bar for taking a sick day is getting lower, and some bosses say that’s a problem.
    > 
    
    > For one, more workers are using up sick time often for reasons such as [mental health](https://www.wsj.com/articles/timeout-days-and-respite-rooms-the-new-trends-in-mental-health-at-the-office-70dcbb08). And unlike older workers, who might have been loath to call in sick ****for fear of seeming weak or unreliable, younger workers feel more entitled to take full advantage of the benefits they’ve been given, executives and recruiters say. That confidence has only grown as [record low unemployment](https://www.wsj.com/economy/jobs/jobs-report-september-economy-unemployment-d9409b8b) persists.
    > 
    > 
    > So far this year, 30% of white-collar ****workers with access to paid leave have taken sick time, up from 21% in 2019, according to data from payroll and benefits software company Gusto. Employees between ages 25 and 34 are taking sick days most often, with their use rates jumping 45% from before the pandemic. Some employers, such as Stellantis, complain such worker absences [are driving up costs](https://www.wsj.com/business/autos/stellantis-negotiations-carlos-tavares-uaw-strike-a0f42954). The Detroit carmaker has repeatedly brought up the issue as contract talks with the United Auto Workers proceed, saying it lost 10.9% of hourly worker time in 2022 because of unplanned absenteeism.
