- Cholera on the rise
    - [The world’s stockpile of cholera vaccine is empty—but relief is on the way - Science](https://www.science.org/content/article/world-s-stockpile-cholera-vaccine-empty-relief-way)
    
    > The world has run out of cholera vaccines—just when the deadly disease is on a rampage not seen in many years. Fifteen countries are currently reporting active outbreaks, with more than 40,900 cases and 775 deaths reported in January alone. But all available doses of oral cholera vaccines in the global stockpile have been allocated until mid-March, Philippe Barboza, cholera team lead at the World Health Organization (WHO), said on 23 February. He said there is now “no buffer for unforeseen outbreaks or preventive campaigns.” The catastrophic shortage is a result not just of a surge in cases, but also of an overdependence on a single vaccine manufacturer, EuBiologics in Seoul, South Korea, whose production capacity is limited.
