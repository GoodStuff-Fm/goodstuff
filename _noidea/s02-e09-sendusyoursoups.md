* Democrats will always lose: a theory
  * Democrats will always aim to defeat trump on a technicality
    * They want an outside arbiter to enforce a rule that dismisses Trump instead of leveraging power to displace him.
    * This is because democrats understand that their only efficacious power is derived from populism.
    * But in order to embrace and use Populist energy they must also confront the divide between working and upper classes
    * Party leadership understand they have more in common with Brett Kavanaugh than AOC. They understand that populist power will likely displace their own, and so they are unwilling to use the only real tool in their arsenal.
