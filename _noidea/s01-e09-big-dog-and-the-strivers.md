* Andrew's theory of Strivers
  * A Striver is someone who fully buys into the Capitalist American Dream
  * They're always going somewhere, never happy with where they are, always comparing themselves to everyone else
  * They have a tendency to make you feel bad, sometimes passively, because they need to know they're better than someone
  * We love it
