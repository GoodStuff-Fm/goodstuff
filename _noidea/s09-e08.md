- [LA controller’s audit of LAPD helicopters questions their benefit, high costs – Daily News](https://www.dailynews.com/2023/12/11/la-controllers-audit-of-lapd-helicopters-questions-their-benefit-high-costs/?utm_medium=email&utm_source=ActiveCampaign&utm_medium=email&utm_content=How+California+climate+action+will+cut+tax+revenue&utm_campaign=WhatMatters)
    
    > The Los Angeles Police Department’s helicopter program spends 61% of its flight time on low-priority incidents at cost of nearly $50 million per year to taxpayers, according to an audit released today by the City Controller’s Office. … The audit focused on LAPD’s use of helicopters from 2018 through 2022, and explored whether the department has “justified the need for the program’s current size and scope, which consists of 17 helicopters and more than 90 employees,” according to the controller’s office.
    > 
    
    > The city operates its helicopter fleet on an almost “continuous basis” — usually there are two helicopters flying for 20 hours every day of the year. The helicopters logged an average of 16,000 hours of flight time each year at a cost of $2,916 per flight hour.
