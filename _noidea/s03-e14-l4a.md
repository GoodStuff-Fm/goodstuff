- Normalize *not* thinking you "had it"
    - All these people who seem to feel an instinctual need to posit, about coronavirus, "I actually think I had it" may be some sign of a weird mass-dellusion
    - Why do they do it?
        - Want to comfort themselves with a hope they can't get it and are safe?
        - Want to latch on to the drama and fold themselves into the whole thing?
        - Just paranoid?
        - TBQC—I have engaged in this
    - We need to stop it. For our sanity.

        > Margaret Thatcher said that “there is no such thing as society,” and Ronald Reagan said that “government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.” These stupid slogans marked the turn away from the postwar period of reconstruction and underpin much of the bullshit of the past forty years.
        We are individuals first, yes, just as bees are, but we exist in a larger social body. Society is not only real; it’s fundamental. We can’t live without it. And now we’re beginning to understand that this “we” includes many other creatures and societies in our biosphere and even in ourselves.

        > Right now we’re hearing two statements being made. One, from the President and his circle: we have to save money even if it costs lives. The other, from the Centers for Disease Control and similar organizations: we have to save lives even if it costs money. Which is more important, money or lives? Money, of course! says capital and its spokespersons. Really? people reply, uncertainly. Seems like that’s maybe going too far? Even if it’s the common wisdom? Or was.
