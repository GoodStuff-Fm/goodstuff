    > While lawyers at other Houston law firms claimed to be happy with remote work, I believe it prevented us from performing at our sharpest. There is a cost to working at home that goes beyond depression, disconnectedness and failing to bathe regularly: It can drain morale and diminish collegiality.

- [Stop Putting Actors Like Jared Leto In a Fat Suit - Discourse Blog](https://discourseblog.com/jared-leto-fat-suit-house-of-gucci/)
    - As a fatmn, yes plz stop

    > It’s messed up! And it’s wrong! Because there are plenty of fat (or just not thin) actors out there that could have been cast for this role, and we didn’t need to see Jared Leto in a goddamn fat suit to accomplish the job.
    Really, if they wanted to cast a fat person, they could have done that, instead of following the industry standard of casting a thin or straight size person to wear a suit that makes them look only a little bit like a fat person but mostly like a thin person wearing several layers of pillows around their arms and torso, with some bad prosthetic covering their neck and face. But no, the people needed their Leto in a fat suit that badly!
    I shouldn’t have to point this out, but it’s lazy, it’s insulting, and it often reinforces negative and harmful stereotypes about fat people. It’s especially insufferable that Leto of all people was put in a fat suit at all. Like, not this fucking guy!!
