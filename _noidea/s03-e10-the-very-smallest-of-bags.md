* Revolutionary Disruptions: an arg
  * There is much opposition to radical or revolutionary societal/national changes for fear of the likely disruptions to everyday life.
  * If everyday life is already being disrupted, why not make radical changes?
  * This is particularly true when the possibly painful changes we’re avoiding would likely solve the underlying thing disrupting our lives.
  * With this in mind, we have even more opportunity to do big and radical changes during disruptive and chaotic times.
