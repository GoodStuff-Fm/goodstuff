        > “During the devastating [2003] strike/lockout that brought Safeway-Vons to their knees, organized (unions) never struck a Jack Brown store.

        “He opened stores in food deserts to support low-income families, supported family-run suppliers and championed employees,” said Flickinger, managing director of retail consulting firm Strategic Resource Group in New York.

        “He was uniquely focused on raising the standards of living for shoppers everywhere. Jack always had the lowest prices on the highest quality product.
