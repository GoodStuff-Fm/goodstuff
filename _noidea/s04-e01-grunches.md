- Coronavirus: it’s still happening
    - Mask it or casket
- First they came for the police unions...
    - [Police unions' power wanes, but how about teachers? - CalMatters](https://calmatters.org/commentary/dan-walters/2020/07/california-police-unions-power-teachers/?utm_source=CalMatters%20Newsletters&utm_campaign=5cf5133ab0-WHATMATTERS_NEWSLETTER&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_faa7be558d-5cf5133ab0-150232425&mc_cid=5cf5133ab0&mc_eid=ec16640261)
    - First of all, the fact the police are a union is so far down on the list of their problems
    - The differences between a police union and a teachers union are important
        - Police are state agents to act *against* the citizens and *for* the state.
        - Teachers have no such enforcement role.
        - Police benefits and pay are astronomically better than teacher benefits and pay.
    - Wan Dalters' example is how the teachers union fights against charter schools
        - This would be like police fighting against privatized security forces,,,, which, like would definitely NOT be an abuse of their union power and in the public interest.
