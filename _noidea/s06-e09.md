    - It's interesting that some people are making this argument because of how flatly ridiculous it is:

- Oh no, The IPCC Report
    - [I don't like IPCC report day - by Emily Atkin - HEATED](https://heated.world/p/i-dont-like-ipcc-report-day?token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo3NTgxMzEsInBvc3RfaWQiOjM5ODAwNTgyLCJfIjoiQ1BhVFkiLCJpYXQiOjE2Mjg2MTAyOTksImV4cCI6MTYyODYxMzg5OSwiaXNzIjoicHViLTI0NzMiLCJzdWIiOiJwb3N0LXJlYWN0aW9uIn0.GGrcgRtB6cAhXDkKthN1hbp2rimh0X0bbXcCurZWspY)

        > Wanna know a secret about the new IPCC report released yesterday? Most people who say they’ve read it have not actually read it. 

        What they’ve read is the 42-page “Summary for Policymakers”—which, in theory, should be totally fine. The summary document is supposed to be the world’s most comprehensive and authoritative summary of the “current state of the climate, including how it is changing and the role of human influence,” according to the IPCC. There’s really no need for the average person to read a 1,300 page report. 

        But here’s another secret: **the term “fossil fuels” is not included in the IPCC’s 42-page summary document, or the IPCC’s press release. So if you only read the summary for policymakers, you won’t actually learn the full role of human influence on the climate.** You’ll find out that human “activities” and “influence” are “unequivocally” causing climate disasters—but which activities and influences are the greatest will remain a mystery. You’ll find out what’s happening to the climate, but you won’t find out why it’s happening or who is responsible. It’s all just “Humans,” “emissions,” “activities,” and “influence.”

        You’ll learn the world is ending, and you will not know who to blame.
