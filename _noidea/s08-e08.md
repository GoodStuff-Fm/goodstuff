- Caffeine: A Neurotoxin?
    
    [https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a43622878/caffeine-addiction/](https://www.esquire.com/lifestyle/health/a43622878/caffeine-addiction/)
    
    > For years, Bivens had been consuming close to 1,000 milligrams of caffeine per day, two and a half times [the daily recommended limit](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/in-depth/caffeine/art-20045678) and the equivalent of more than ten cups of coffee. The habit had wreaked havoc on his central nervous system and in turn caused myriad physical and psychological problems.
    > 
    > 
    > “People don’t understand that caffeine is an actual drug,” says Bivens. “It’s not Kool-Aid.”
    > 
    > “More people need to know that caffeine is a neurotoxin and it’s hurting you,” Bivens says. “I would like people to treat caffeine the way we treat cigarettes. There should be a warning.”
