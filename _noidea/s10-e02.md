  - AI scam

        An AI scam using the voice of Rome’s defense minister has targeted Italy’s top tycoons, urging them to wire funds to help free Italian journalists locked up abroad. At least one executive apparently transferred ~$1M, falling prey to an elaborate scheme launched just after an Italian journalist was detained in Iran.

    - <https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-09/italian-elite-targeted-by-scammers-using-ai-voice-impersonation>

        > Scammers used an artificial intelligence voice tool to impersonate Italy’s Defense Minister Guido Crosetto and his staff in an attempt to persuade some of the nation’s top businessmen to wire money overseas.

        Prada SpA co-Chief Executive Officer Patrizio Bertelli, fashion designer Giorgio Armani, Pirelli & C. SpA Executive Vice Chairman Marco Tronchetti Provera and billionaire Massimo Moratti, former owner of the Inter Milan football club, were among those targeted, according to reports by Italian newspapers La Repubblica, Corriere della Sera and others.

- De-centering Celebrities
  - You know how everyone is like, “I learned about this product from [insert celeb/influencer here]”?
  - We used to be like, “I learned about this from that old guy down at the garage they call Lefty.”
