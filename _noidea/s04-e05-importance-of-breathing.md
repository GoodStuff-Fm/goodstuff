- Mayor Ghirardelli - Nothing's my fault and I have no power
    - Possible new names for him:
        - Derrick Rigatoni
        - Merrick don Confetti
    - People say it's racist to confuse his name with some other Italian surname
    - This is impossible because Italians aren't human

    > Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti on Sunday said L.A. opened too quickly and again warned that the city was close to imposing some type of new stay-at-home order as coronavirus cases continued to spike. 

    Speaking on CNN, Garcetti was asked about a Los Angeles Times editorial that criticized the rapid reopening of California, which was followed by a major surge in both new COVID-19 cases and hospitalizations. 

    "I think a lot of people don’t understand, mayors often have no control what opens up and doesn’t — that’s either at a state or county level," Garcetti said. "And I do agree that those things happened too quickly."
