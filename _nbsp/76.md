minutes


Sean Vanaman is a video game designer, writer, and podcast host. He was the co-project leader and lead writer of *The Walking Dead*,and *Puzzle Agent 2*. He also wrote the third episode of *Tales of Monkey Island*, and was the designer of *Wallace & Gromit‚Äôs Grand Adventures*, and the writer of the third episode, *Muzzled*. He is one of the regular hosts of the *Idle Thumbs* podcast.


Sean co-founded the new video game company, Campos Santo, and their first game, *Firewatch*, is an emotional first person adventure that centers around the character, Henry,  a man whose love life is in free fall. He takes a job as fire lookout in the Shoshone National Forest as a way to isolate himself and numb him from his problems.  His only contact with the outside world is through a walkie talkie to his supervisor, Deliah, another lookout on a tower many, many miles away. Within the lush, stytlized, and expansive forest they unravel mysteries that could endanger their lives.
