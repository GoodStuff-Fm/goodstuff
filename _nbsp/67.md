date: 2016-02-16 12:11:00 -06:00
description: 'Simon St. Laurent is back to talk about #Snowpocalypse, camera drones
  in NYC, the legacy of our work, and owning your own stuff —except for those conversations
  we have on Facebook. We take a look at what we saw this past month in the web space
  (and more) and what we think is happening on the horizon as we slip further into
  2016.'
