minutes


From Austin, Texas, Iâ€™m Christopher Schmitt and on this episode, Iâ€™m joined with Nick Pettit. Nick is a teacher at Treehouse, an online web education company.  He is also an independent virtual reality (VR) game developer. On November 15th, he releases his first major game called &ldquo;Neptune Flux,&rdquo; which can be experienced on VR headsets like the Oculus Rift, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR. There are also non-VR variations of the game that can be played on PC, Mac, and PlayStation 4.
