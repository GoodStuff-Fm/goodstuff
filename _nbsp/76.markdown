description: Sean Vanaman is a video game designer, writer, and podcast host. He was
  the co-project leader and lead writer of The Walking Dead,and Puzzle Agent 2. He
  also wrote the third episode of Tales of Monkey Island, and was the designer of
  Wallace & Gromit’s Grand Adventures, and the writer of the third episode, Muzzled.
  He is one of the regular hosts of the Idle Thumbs podcast. Sean co-founded the new
  video game company, Campos Santo, and their first game, Firewatch, is an emotional
  first person adventure that centers around the character, Henry, a man whose love
  life is in free fall. He takes a job as fire lookout in the Shoshone National Forest
  as a way to isolate himself and numb him from his problems. His only contact with
  the outside world is through a walkie talkie to his supervisor, Deliah, another
  lookout on a tower many, many miles away. Within the lush, stytlized, and expansive
  forest they unravel mysteries that could endanger their lives.
