title: Bruce Floyd & Todd Sanders — Social Media
date: 2016-06-21 12:11:00 -06:00
description: While social media replaced the cultural tradition of inviting friends
  over for dinner and then subjecting them to a slide show of your vacation, it’s
  more than that to organizations and companies. It’s communication, promotion, boasting,
  customer service, brand awareness, and more. Bruce Floyd is the Social Media Manager
  at University of Florida Athletic Association and Todd Sanders is Director of Social
  Media at University of Florida. While one covers student athletics and the other
  covers academia and campus life respectfully, together they cover largest portions
  of the University of Florida’s social media brand. We ask how they handle social
  media for two similar, but distinctly different parts of Gator Nation.
