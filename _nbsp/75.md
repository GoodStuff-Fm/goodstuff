Episode № 75
PixelJam — Indie Game Developers


April 26th, 2016
&middot;
63
minutes


Based out of Asheville, NC, Miles Tilmann and Rich Grillotti make up the leadership of PixelJam, an indie game development company. Since 2005, they&rsquo;ve created their own video games mostly in the retro pixelation format that defined the look and feel of 1980s console games such as Gamma Bros.,  Dino Run, and PotatoMan Seeks The Troof. However, some games have other visual styles like Glorkian Warrior, show they can shed the retro feel and still make an engaging game. They&rsquo;ve also produced mobile games for late night cable station, Adult Swim, such as Hipster Kickball and Pizza City.
