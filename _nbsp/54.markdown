description: This episode we have Elyse Holladay. Elyse’s been at Sass Summit and
  also a local Austenite—very glad to get a chance to talk to her today. We talked
  about organizing a physical conference, how she got into the web, of course, passion
  for work, and diversity in conferences, new speakers, a lot of topics.
