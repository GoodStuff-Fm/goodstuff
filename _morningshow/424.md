## Today's Special

### National Mai Tai Day

**HISTORY:**

Victor J. Bergeron claimed to have invented the Mai Tai in 1944 at his restaurant, [Trader Vic's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trader_Vic%27s), in Oakland, California. Trader Vic's forerunner, [Donn Beach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_the_Beachcomber), claimed to have instead first created it in 1933, although a longtime colleague said that Beach was actually just alleging that the Mai Tai was based on his [Q.B. Cooler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q.B._Cooler) cocktail. Don the Beachcomber's recipe is more complex than Vic's and some believe it tastes quite different. Others believe that, despite the difference in ingredients, they taste quite similar.

The name was allegedly taken from maita'i, the [Tahitian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tahitian_language) word for "good" or "excellence", although the drink is usually spelled as two words, sometimes hyphenated or capitalized.
