## Today's Special

### National Cheese Soufflé Day

* The word soufflé is the past participle of the French verb souffler which means “to blow up” or more loosely “puff up”—an apt description of what happens to this combination of custard and egg whites.
* The first recipe for soufflé appeared in Vincent La Chapelle’s Le Cuisinier Moderne in 1742.
* The Guinness Book record soufflé in the Palestinian town of Nablus weighed 3,891 pounds, and was 243 feet long before it was consumed in ten minutes.
* The secret to a great soufflé is to beat the egg whites into stiff white peak consistency and to fold them carefully into the sauce to keep as much air in the mixture as possible.
