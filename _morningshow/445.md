## Today's Special

### National Monte Cristo Day

A Monte Cristo sandwich is an egg-dipped or batter-dipped ham and cheese sandwich that is pan or deep fried, a variation of the French croque monsieur ('Mister Crunchy').

The Monte Cristo Sandwich is an American variation of French Croque Monsieur sandwiches that first appeared on the menu of a Paris cafe in 1910.

From the 1930s to the 1960s, American cookbooks had recipes for this sandwich under such names as "French sandwich", "toasted ham sandwich", and "French toasted cheese sandwich". The Monte Cristo sandwich supposedly entered the scene in the 1960s in Southern California, and exploded in popularity after the Blue Bayou Restaurant in Disneyland began serving it.
