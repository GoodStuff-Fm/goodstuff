### What do penguins drink?
When ashore they will drink fresh water from pools and streams and can sometimes be seen drinking water preened off their backs during rain showers. At sea penguins must drink salt water and they are able to do this because they have special glands abound the eye sockets that extract excess salt from the blood.

## [National Rice Ball Day](http://www.joyofkosher.com/2012/04/national-rice-ball-day/)
Rice balls or "onigiri" are a Japanese food made from white rice formed into triangular or oval shapes and often wrapped in nori (seaweed). Traditionally, an onigiri is filled with pickled ume (umeboshi), salted salmon, katsuobushi, kombu, tarako, or any other salty or sour ingredient as a natural preservative. Because of the popularity of onigiri in Japan, most convenience stores stock their onigiri with various fillings and flavors. There are even specialized shops whose only products are onigiri for take out.

### Five Fun Rice Facts:
1. Rice is the second highest worldwide production after maize (corn). Since maize is mostly grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain for human consumption.
2. There are more than 40,000 varieties of rice that grow on every continent except on Antarctica.
3. Rice is a symbol of life and fertility, which is why rice was traditionally thrown at weddings.
4. If you leave rice in your bowl it is considered rude.
5. There is enough rice that grows in Arkansas, California, Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi and Missouri to rank the USA as the twentieth largest rice producer in the world and the second largest exported of rice. About half of all the rice grown in the USA is exported.
