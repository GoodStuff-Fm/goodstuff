## Fun Facts
- [Tomato frogs secrete a glue that causes a predator’s lips to stick together.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomato_frog) When a predator grabs a tomato frog in its mouth, the frog's skin secretes a thick substance that gums up the predator's eyes and mouth, causing the predator to release the frog to free up its eyes. The gummy substance contains a toxin that occasionally causes allergic reactions in humans. The allergic reaction will not kill a human and the frog secretes it only when frightened.
