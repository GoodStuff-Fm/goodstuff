## Today's Special

### National Fajita Day

A fajita, in Tex-Mex cuisine, is any stripped grilled meat with stripped peppers and onions that is usually served on a flour or corn tortilla. The term originally referred to skirt steak, the cut of beef first used in the dish. Popular meats used include chicken and other cuts of beef, as well as vegetables instead of meat.

In many restaurants, the fajita meat and vegetables are brought to the table sizzling loudly on a metal platter or skillet, along with warmed tortillas and condiments such as guacamole, pico de gallo, queso, salsa, shredded cheese or sour cream.

**2 FACTS:**

1 - In 1969, Sonny Falcon (great name) makes the first recorded fajita sales from his concession booth in Kyle, Texas.

2 - The word "fajita" used to define the dish officially appears in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1971.

* Although fajita originally referred to these strips of beef skirt, fajitas now are made with a variety of fillings, such as green/red/yellow peppers, onions, chilies, and jalape√±o peppers
