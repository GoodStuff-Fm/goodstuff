description: "It’s October! My favorite part of the podcasting season and episode
  399 is no exception. After a few weeks of organizing, we have guests [NickJLancaster](https://twitter.com/NickJLancaster) and [TweetsbyAndrew](https://twitter.com/TweetsbyAndrew) of
  the [Something Old, Something New, Something Borrowed, Something Brewed Podcast](https://www.sosnsbsbpodcast.com/).
  This one is jam-packed with news, topics, and a heated round of “Ska Band or Racehorse?”
  \n\nThis is also one of the few episodes of Morning Show with a guest, but is not
  going to be the last. Stay tuned!"
