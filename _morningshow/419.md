## Today's Special

## National Corn on the Cob Day

### **ABOUT**

Some call it “corn-stick,” others go with “sweet pole,” but we like to call it amazing — especially when you use those cute plastic corn on the cob handles. National Corn on the Cob Day falls on June 11 — the perfect pre-summer date. (Although, for most home gardens, mid-June is still too early for the harvest.) But you can’t blame anyone for being in a hurry. The sweetness doesn’t hang around for very long. It has to be picked at its freshest, otherwise there’s a risk of — nothing really — it’s just slightly less incredible tasting.

### DEBATE

Many people say as long as you hold both ends you're good to go, but you know better. According to etiquette experts, you should butter a few rows at a time, and then eat moving side to side like a typewriter. (Or a keyboard if you're under 80.)
