## Two Stupid Games
### Question Time
- Is it okay to use bar soap in lieu of shampoo?
- Is soup a beverage or a food?
- If you could only survive on 1 canned food for a year, which would you choose?
- Pizza rolls or hot pockets? (or bagel bites?)

### Would you Rather...
- ...only be able to eat food by licking it, or never be able to use utensils to eat again?
- ...have leg sized fingers or finger sized legs?
