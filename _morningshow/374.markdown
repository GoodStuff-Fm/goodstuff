### Taco Bell or Not
[Download](https://www.dropbox.com/s/gxnpum6i1d98h7u/Taco%20Bell%20or%20Not.mp3?dl=0)

Taco Bell Taco Bell Menu or Not
Taco Bell sting and Taco Bell scream
Goin' and blowin' up buttholes of fun
Now the Taco Trot has begun,

Taco Bell Taco Bell Menu or Not
Taco Bell slime and Talk about mine,
Dancin' and prancin' a Taco Bell scare
It'll cost me there!

Want a nice time?
Skip inside line,
and drive thru all the way

Taco Bell time, it's a hell time,
to go hiding for a one-hour stay.

Eating up tacos or burrito treats
Won't make it more than a block,
Mexican pizza and a crunchwrap supreme,
Taco Bell or Not!

Taco Bell time, it's a hell time,

Eating up tacos or burrito treats
Won't make it more than a block,
Mexican pizza and a crunchwrap supreme,
Is it Taco Bell,
Is it Taco Bell,
Taco Bell or Not!
