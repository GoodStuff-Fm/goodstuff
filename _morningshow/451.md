## Today's Special

National American Beer Day

How many national beer days are there?

While we’re of the mind that any day can be a national beer day, there are a few of note worth mentioning including International Beer Day (August 2), National Beer Day (April 7), and National Beer Can Appreciation Day (January 24).

1587: Colonists in Virginia work together to create the first American-brewed beers.

1852: Anheuser-Busch is founded as “Bavarian Brewery.” Now the #1 beer producer in America, the company reports it commands 46% of U.S. beer sales.
