description: Crown roast of pork earns its name when a pork loin is formed into a
  circle with the ribs pointing upwards forming the points of a crown. Often they
  are held together with twine.  It is then seasoned, and often stuffed, roasted and
  served, making a beautiful centerpiece on the table. The ends of the bones may be
  given a paper frill treatment for added decoration.
