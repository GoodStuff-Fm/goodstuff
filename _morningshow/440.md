## Today's Special

### National Cherry Popover Day

"Surprisingly, there is no National Popover Day, although plain popovers are divine—perhaps our favorite bread. 

Popovers are delicate, almost hollow “rolls” that majestically rise up over the tops of the pans they’re baked in (i.e., they pop over). 

The outsides are crisp and brown, the interiors soft and airy. The tops “pop over” the baking tin. In the U.K. they’re called Yorkshire pudding and are often served as a side with a slice of prime rib or other beef.

In the U.S., they’re enjoyed as a special substitute for roll or biscuit, and are often served at brunch with butter or jam (although neither is required)."

Popovers are not difficult to make. The only challenge is to serve them quickly, since as they cool they deflate. You can reheat leftovers in the microwave. They won’t return to their original puffiness, but they’ll still be yummy.

The popover is an American version of Yorkshire pudding, a batter pudding made in England since the 17th century. 

Both use the same batter. The difference: 

Popovers are baked in individual molds like custard cups. (Today, special muffins-like tins are used, although regular muffin tins can be used for shorter, flatter popovers)). 

Yorkshire pudding is traditionally baked in the pan of drippings from a roast beef (roast beef and Yorkshire pudding is a signature British dish).   The oldest known written reference to popovers dates to 1850; the first cookbook recipe was published in 1876.
