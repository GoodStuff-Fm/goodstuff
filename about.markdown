Goodstuff was created as a home for podcasts that are entertaining, informative, and fun. Our goal is to create a vibrant community of podcasters who love to learn about the world around them and share that with an equally awesome group of listeners.

We've been podcasting since March, 2014. Thank you so much for listening.

Goodstuff.fm is run by Chris Enns and Kyle Roderick and they're joined by a group of [amazing hosts and co-hosts][1] who help create all the great shows™ you hear each week.

Kyle Roderick lives in sunny California where he works as a product designer for a company that loves to talk about beer.

Chris Enns lives in wintery Saskatchewan where he runs a web design and podcast production company 🍋 out of his snow cave.
