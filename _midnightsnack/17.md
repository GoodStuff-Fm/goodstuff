description: As the holidays draw near, a young heiress contends with the
  affections of a suitor handpicked by her mother. When the handsome chef,
  Harland Sanders, arrives with his secret fried chicken recipe and a dream, he
  sets in motion a series of events that unravels the mother’s devious plans.
  Will our plucky heiress escape to her wintry happily ever after with Harland
  at her side, or will she cave to the demands of family and duty?
