Thank you so much for your interest in sponsoring. We love sponsors whose products or services we love and use.

We typically sell our sponsorships on a run-of-network basis, which means your ad is featured on all of our shows for the length of your sponsorship. Individual shows are also available for sponsorship if you'd prefer. Goodstuff.fm offers week-long, month-long, or quarter-long sponsorships.

### Sponsorships typically include:

* A mention during the introduction of the show.
* A 2-3 minute spot in the mid-roll of the show (depending on the show)
* Thanks at the end of the show
* Link in the episode page and RSS feed
* Run-of-network sponsorships also recieve a tweet at the beginning and end of each week from the [Goodstuff.fm Twitter account][1].
