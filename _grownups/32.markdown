description: Kari and Brook talk about Canada, some stuff you (assuming you're not
  a Canadian) might not know about Canada. Justin Trudeau is cute. Colonialist settlement
  was kinda horrible, and the government's (historical and current) treatment of indigenous
  people is too. Pipelines, sex work, socialized medicine, parental leave, RCMP, blinking
  green lights, friendliness.
