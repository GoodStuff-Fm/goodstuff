[Speaking While Female - NYTimes.com](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/01/11/opinion/sunday/speaking-while-female.html)


When a woman speaks in a professional setting, she walks a tightrope. Either she’s barely heard or she’s judged as too aggressive. When a man says virtually the same thing, heads nod in appreciation for his fine idea. As a result, women often decide that saying less is more.

[On not doing things. | the other hilary](http://theotherhilary.ca/on-not-writing/)


I’m reading so, so much from women of colour on Twitter and my problems are nothing, my complaints infinitesimal in comparison. I am trying to support, to decenter myself in discussions and this is new territory for me to navigate as an opinion(ated) writer. I hate how much I use “I”. It’s always bothered me.
