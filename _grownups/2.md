Episode № 2
Retire Before I Die


September 23rd, 2014

Kari and Jay Baron talk about comparing our adult lives to our parents, perpetual adolescence, what it’s like being a role model, and scratching undone things off the bucket list. We try really hard not to be a parenting podcast.

####Links and Show Notes


It’s only episode 2 and I’m already forgetting my structure! Forgot the Quote of the Episode (will have to catch that next time). And I forgot the Acknowledgement of the Episode; I’d like to thank Chris Enns; without his helpful pointers, this episode never would have been recorded.
