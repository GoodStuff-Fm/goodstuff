description: For Grown-Ups' first threesome, Kari and Brook are joined by Kayleigh
  to talk about polyamorism, paramours and metamours and poly unicorns, cis/straight
  and queer poly, models and structures of poly relationships, how to (and how not
  to) go polyamorous, jealousy, compersion, and how poly is like Agile. Turns out,
  Kari's the only one who's seen Three's Company. Also, we talk about butts.
