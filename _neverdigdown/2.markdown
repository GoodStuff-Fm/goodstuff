[Captive Minecraft II — The Farlanders](http://thefarlanders.com/captiveminecraftii/)

Captive Minecraft II is the successor to the original Captive Minecraft, released in May 2014.  This new vanilla game type traps you in a 1x1 box using 1.8's World Border feature.  For each Minecraft Achievement you get, the World Border widens by half a block in each direction.  As your captive world slowly expands, you gain access to more and more resources and hidden secrets.
