<p>In this episode Paul incorrectly identified the song “I Am Superman” as being originally by REM. REM’s version was also a cover, and song is actually by The Clique. He also incorrectly identified “I’d Love to Change the World” as being originally by Jetta, but THAT was a cover of the original by Ten Years After. My mistake!</p>

<p>The questions from the audience are a bit hard to hear, so here they are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Q1: What aspect of Legion drew you into it?</li>
  <li>Q2: You said this is an FX show, it’s a Fox property. Are you worried the show is going to change now that Fox is owned by Disney, bringing it into the wider Marvel universe if they decide to go down that route?</li>
</ul>

<p>And if you’re interested you can find the slides that went along with this panel <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/kfy1fzcxn99yiso/Clockworks%20Slides.pptx?dl=0">here</a></p>
