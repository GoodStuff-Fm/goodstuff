description: "The big news this week, of course, is the launch of U2's Sirius XM station. Collin, Sherry, Ian and Mason discuss whether it's worth the price of subscription, what it's like to have U2 on speeddial and whether or not the band will go beyond the surface of things in their catalog for content. This brings up the next discussion, a deep dive into one of U2's deepest album cuts, FEZ - Being Born."
