description: "Walk On was once one of U2's most beloved anthems of hope, courage and activism. In recent years, the band has had to distance themselves from the song's inspiration, Aung San Suu Kyi, and haven't played it since. Inspired by Ian Ryan's recent Like A Song article, Ian, Amy, Becky and Collin talk about what the song means to them and how it can be re-purposed so it can be enjoyed again."
