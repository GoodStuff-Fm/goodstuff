description: We&rsquo;re joined by special guest Mark Baker, aka U2Brothr, to talk
  about his documentary, his experiences getting on stage with U2, and what it was
  like to be a part of a contest on U2.com to go to Paris only to find out he wouldn&rsquo;t
  be going after all. We also played Name that Tune with Mark - as a bass player in
  a U2 tribute band you&rsquo;d think he&rsquo;d do pretty good, right? And we also
  talk a bit about the upcoming shows in Dublin, Ireland.
