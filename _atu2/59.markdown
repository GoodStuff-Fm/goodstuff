Hello - chris here. As I record this, U2's just finished their 3rd show on the Joshua Tree 2017 tour - but back after the opening show in Vancouver we recorded a conversation with a group of us on Periscope to debrief our thoughts after taking in the show. As the token Canadian, I'll apologize in advance for the audio - it was recorded on a (Red) iPhone, naturally, but the recording is a bit rough and there was some nice background muzak that the hotel couldn't turn off for some reason...  

Enjoy our conversation and we'll be back again next episode with more from atu2.com
