description: Kelly, Beth, Ian, and Chris go all the way back to Larry's first U2 logo
  on a shirt and talk through the U2's history of design. What we love, what we hate,
  and the little things that we notice along the way.

  provided by Mimo Live. Learning how to use mimoLive is child's play – literally.
  Its logical and intuitive production workflow can be mastered by anyone from school
  kids to senior citizens in very short time. And yet it is so powerful, it also satisfies
  the broadcasting veterans wildest dreams."
