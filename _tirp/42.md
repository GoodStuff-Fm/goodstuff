Some Sunday evening reading for you: I published a response to @seanwes’ article on profanity. http://avc.io/U0tKOC

[Cheap, Lazy, & Foolish: Professional Profanity by seanwes](http://seanwes.com/2014/cheap-lazy-foolish-professional-profanity/)


Look, I don’t care if you stub your toe and loose a four-letter exclamation. Unexpected pain, knee-jerk reaction, it’s on the tip of your tongue—I get it.

[On Professional Profanity and Being Yourself](http://avclark.com/on-professional-profanity-and-being-yourself/)


I felt the need to respond with an article of my own, because I disagree so strongly. Coincidentally, I just had a long conversation on Twitter with my friend Jonathan Christopher on the same topic. The issue appears to be on people’s minds, at least within my circles.
