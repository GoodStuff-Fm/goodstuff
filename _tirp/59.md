Chris is out, so Adam and Tim talk about finding meaning in your work, not wanting to be web designers anymore, and follow-up on the whole “golden age of podcasting” thing.


#####
[The Intellectual Radio Program #58: Black Market Podcasts - Goodstuff FM](http://goodstuff.fm/tirp/58)


Chris is out again, so Adam, Tim and Kyle talk about podcasts, The Gently Mad being rebooted, and quitting things either too soon, or too late.

[Snell-o-vision — How to watch "Doctor Who"](http://jsnell.intertext.com/post/69570512310/how-to-watch-doctor-who)


With the 50th anniversary of the show having just passed, there’s a lot of buzz about “Doctor Who” out there, especially among people who haven’t ever gotten into the show. (We also did an entire Incomparable episode about it.) Fifty years of history is pretty daunting, so if you’re on the outside looking in I can see how it would be a bit intimidating to take on such a project.


#####
[The Incomparable | Forcegiving (Episode 222)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/222/index.php)(Episode 222)


There’s now a teaser trailer for “Star Wars: The Force Awakens”, and you know we have opinions. And so, in great Incomparable fashion, we’re here to talk about 80 seconds of video for more than an hour. How could we not?

#####
[The Incomparable | Full-Fledged Force Mullet (Episode 182)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/182/)(Episode 182)


Against the advice of our doctors, we’re back with more prequels. This time it’s “Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones.” With three different opening statements, our podcast is about as bureaucratic as the Imperial Senate. We also discuss R2’s incompetence as a security system, ponder Anakin’s puzzling pick-up lines (and haircut), sympathize with the boring job of the Jedi, and question the plight of the Fett family and the clone troopers. (Part 1 of 2.)


#####
[The Incomparable | How I Sold Your Mother (Episode 183)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/183/)(Episode 183)


Do you like sand? Then you may get upset as we conclude our discussion of “Star Wars: Episode II — Attack of the Clones,” in which we ponder the mystery of droid consciousness, fail to get excited about seeing our old friends from Episode I again, open a Variety Pack of monsters, debate Yoda’s fighting strategy, and talk John Siracusa off the ledge. Finally, we ponder whether it’s worse for a movie to be bad or boring. (Part 2 of 2.)


#####
[The Incomparable | We Waited 16 Years For This? (Episode 136)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/136/)(Episode 136)


They said it couldn’t be done! They said it shouldn’t be done! But here we are, talking about “Star Wars: Episode I — The Phantom Menace.” Why are the Jedi such jerks? A little Jedi goes a long way. Also, the biggest letdown of John Siracusa’s life to date, stupid droids, good actors being boring, text versus subtext, the merits of prequels in general, and why this is a movie that makes us dream… of a better movie. Exqueeze me? (Part 1 of 2.)


#####
[The Incomparable | Go Wash a Droid (Episode 137)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/137/)(Episode 137)


We conclude our discussion of “Star Wars: Episode I - The Phantom Menace.” We discuss the merits of podracing, debate who the Jedi’s version of Fonzie is, and grapple with tricky euphemisms. Plus, is the final lightsaber duel cool or just over-choreographed? And why is there a hall full of forcefields, next to a room with no guard rails? Party on, Darth! (Part 2 of 2.)


#####
[The Incomparable | I Like My Coffee Like My Evil Sith Lords (Episode 46)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/46/)(Episode 46)


“Star Wars,” the original film, is finally in our crosshairs, and if we can bulls-eye a Womp Rat we can take on this classic sci-fi film. We talk about our first memories of Star Wars, pretend the prequels didn’t happen, give Cantina drink-ordering tips, and marvel at Darth Vader’s coffee-drinking habits. (Part 1 of 2.)


#####
[The Incomparable | Death Star University (Episode 47)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/47/)(Episode 47)


Continuing our discussion of “Star Wars,” the original film. We praise the jump to hyperspace, explain why TIE fighter pilots wear black, ponder how Han and Leia somehow turn up in an Aaron Sorkin scene, reveal why there is no Space OSHA, comment on Ben Kenobi’s old man slippers and incomparable pseudonym, and expose the rebellion so rich it can have its own university and mint its own medals. (Part 2 of 2.)


#####
[The Incomparable | Darth Vader's Office is Really Weird (Episode 67)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/67/)(Episode 67)


Launch your probe droids and cut open your tauntaun! It’s time for part one of our two-part discussion of “The Empire Strikes Back.” Does Han Solo just want to be loved? Is Chewie sabotaging the Falcon on purpose? Why is snowy Hoth the setting? Why is Ben Kenobi a man of few words? Who’s scruffy-lookin’? And what is the purpose for Darth Vader’s clamshell office, anyway?


#####
[The Incomparable | Jedi Weekend (Episode 68)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/68/)(Episode 68)


Gather some bounty hunters and warm up the carbon freezer! It’s time for the conclusion of our epic discussion of “The Empire Strikes Back.” We dissect the evolution of the Han-Leia relationship, the truly playful nature of Yoda and the importance of Dagobah, Vader’s agenda and his crunchy gloves, and Luke’s continuing adventures with garbage.


#####
[The Incomparable | Skywalker's Eleven (Episode 88)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/88/)(Episode 88)


We tackle the last of the classic “Star Wars” trilogy, “Return of the Jedi.” Why does Jabba the Hutt enjoy avant-garde wall hangings and ’80s dance moves? Isn’t it sad how Boba Fett goes out with a whimper? Are the alien languages in “Star Wars” too fake-sounding? And what’s up with Leia’s metal bikini? (Part 1 of 2.)


#####
[The Incomparable | Also Known as Endor (Episode 89)](http://www.theincomparable.com/theincomparable/89/)(Episode 89)


We wrap up our six-part series on the classic “Star Wars” movies with the climactic final half of “Return of the Jedi.” We discuss how the Empire is ahead of the rebels every step of the way, question Luke’s choice of forest camouflage, and explain why Ewoks are better unsubtitled. Also, how is Luke’s journey to being a Jedi not like what you see in most action movies? Who is more heroic in the end, Luke or Vader? Why does the Emperor wait so long to show us his lightning fingers? Why are rebel ships equipped with fireworks? And is Endor the name of the moon, or the name of the planet the moon is orbiting, or both?

[Goodstuff 2.0 — Medium](https://medium.com/@Goodstuff/goodstuff-2-0-e638d0b4e195)


Back when Adam Clark, Tim Smith and I, Chris Enns, launched Goodstuff we had the basic idea of wanting to join together and try to build something bigger than any of us could do on our own. And over the past 7 months we certainly have done that. Goodstuff Broadcasting has experienced incredible growth in listeners — thank you to each new pair of ears that’s taken a chance on an episode of one of our shows.
