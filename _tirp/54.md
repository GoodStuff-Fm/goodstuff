####Links and Show Notes

#####
[Minimal Mac | Not For Me](http://minimalmac.com/post/100558434139/not-for-me)


Well, it is a reminder to me that one does not have to upgrade to the latest OS or Model. It’s a reminder that just because something new comes out, it does not mean that this thing that I have will not continue to serve me for a long time to come exactly the way it is. If it works today it will likely work just as well tomorrow and for many tomorrows to come.

[A week with the iPhone 6 — Red Teams](http://redteams.net/gear/2014/a-week-with-the-iphone-6)


This review will be devided in two parts, the iPhone 6 review and iOS 8. Now, a little disclaimer: I love Apple products, both hardware and software, however I am so dissapointed of this phone and the latest OS that I was compelled to write a bad review. I never write bad reviews, if a piece of gear makes it to the blog is because it is great and we love it and we want everyone to try it. Yet, here it is, a bad review.

[The Best iPhone 6 Case (so far) | The Wirecutter](http://thewirecutter.com/reviews/best-iphone-6-case/)(so far)


The NGP line of cases comes in five translucent colors as well as opaque black. It retails for $20 but usually sells for less. Although this is a great case, it’s still early—the new iPhones are only about a month old so far. We’ll continue to be on the lookout for newer and better options as they’re released, updating this piece regularly.
