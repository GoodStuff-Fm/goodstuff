Description: Kari has two daughters, a husband, a minivan, and a mortgage. Not unrelated
  to this, she also has a career in enterprise software development. Lately, she’s
  fixated on soccer, feminism, and making stuff. She kinda hyperventilates when she
  thinks something’s beautiful. She is allergic to being wrong (cheeks flush, eyes
  well up with tears, chest constricts), so she self-medicates with exposure therapy.
Visible: 'Yes'
