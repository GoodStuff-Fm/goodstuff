Tim has been building web sites since 1997 and specializes in delivering standards-based HTML5/CSS templates. His eye for design and serious affinity for clean code allow him to painlessly integrate his templates into larger systems without sacrificing user experience or aesthetics.

Tim started in the non-profit world, moved on to start-ups, shifted to an agency, upgraded to publishing, and from thence: [Monkey Do](http://monkeydo.biz/).
