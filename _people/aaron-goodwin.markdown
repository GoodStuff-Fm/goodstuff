I’m a creative mind working at the intersection of technology and education. From starting a small computer business at sixteen to my current position in IT at a charter school, my expertise has been finding innovative solutions to enable people to do their work.

Insatiably curious, I voraciously research and read, then seek to share what I’ve learned. Keeping my finger on the pulse of tech news, I find new ways to tackle old problems.

Additionally, I blog about technology, education, and religion.
