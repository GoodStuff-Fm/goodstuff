date: 2017-10-20 10:00:00 -06:00
description: In this Halloween-adjacent episode of WTS Paul and Jan talk about Paranorman.
  Our conversation touches on the Bechdel Test and the Smurfette Principle (again!),
  the relationship of bullying to zombieism, and what speaking to the dead has to
  do with being gay.
