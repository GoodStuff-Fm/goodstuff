description: On this episode we talk about our second batch of Pixar Shorts. We're
  talking Geri's Game, For the Birds, Mike's New Car, Boundin', and Jack Jack Attack.
  We talk about whether senility is funny, body shapes, how to care for babies, and
  why comedy depends on punishment. I hope you like it!
