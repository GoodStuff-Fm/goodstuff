description: This episode of WTS is all about Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone.
  We're focusing only on the movie, and trying our darndest not to turn this into
  an episode about the book(s). We talk about why the chosen one is a boy, the ethics
  fat shaming, and whether the Sorting Hat is inherently monstrous.
