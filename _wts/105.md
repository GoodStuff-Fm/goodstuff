description: "Hello Patrons! Welcome to a new WTS Disney showdown bracket minisode. This time we're talking Pocahontas vs Frozen, and only one will advance to the next round! We've given our children codenames (or rather, they've chosen codenames for themselves): Eldest is Potato, and youngest is Pineapple."
