We’d love to hear your thoughts about UP! It’s one of our favourites. How about you? Is there a six-minute sequence in any movie that is more emotionally affecting than the first six minutes of UP? If so, we’d love to hear about it!  We’d also love to hear your thoughts about any of the children’s movies we’ve talked about on Way Too Seriously. [Talk to us on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/wtscast) and let us know what you think. Or shoot us an email at waytooseriouslycast at gmail.com if what you have to say will take more than 140 characters.
