We’d love to hear from you! You can talk to us about Babies, or any of the movies we’ve talked about, or you can even just say hi by [tweeting to us](http://www.twitter.com/wtscast), or shooting us an email at waytooseriously at gmail.com if what you have to say will take more than 140 characters! You can also [discuss this episode in our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Goodstuff_fm/). We’re on [facebook](http://facebook.com/clockworkscast) and [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/clockworkscast) too if you care about those things!
