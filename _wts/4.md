title: 'Megamind: Everybody Loves Roxie'
date: 2017-07-07 09:11:00 -06:00
description: In this episode of Way Too Seriously, Jan and Paul talk about Megamind.
  We express our sympathy with Dreamworks for always being the runner-up, this time
  to Despicable Me. We also talk about why Roxie is a love interest for every male
  character in the movie, whether the fact that Megamind is blue makes him count as
  a person of colour, and Brad Pitt and the nature of privilege.
