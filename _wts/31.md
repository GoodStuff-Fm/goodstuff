title: 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: Oompa loompa doompa dee don’t'
date: 2018-01-12 10:00:00 -06:00
description: On this episode we talk about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That’s the 2005 version with Freddie Highmore as Charlie, not the 1971 one with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, which isn’t called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at all, it’s called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory so there really shouldn’t be any confusion. In this episode we talk about supporting art made by bad people, about whether Oompa Loompas are redeemable, and about why candy is only bad if you are fat.
