date: 2018-01-26 10:00:00 -06:00
description: "In this episode we’re talking about a movie that was called Leap! in the United States but Ballerina everywhere else! We talk about how just because someone kisses you that doesn't mean she's your girlfriend, VICTOR. We also cover competitive female relationships, and how passion and talent don't always go together."
