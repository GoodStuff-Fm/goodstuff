title: 'Ballerina/Leap!: Dance Like Nobody’s Watching Except Your Teacher Who Will
  Judge You'
date: 2018-01-26 10:00:00 -06:00
description: In this episode we’re talking about a movie that was called Leap! in
  the United States but Ballerina everywhere else! We talk about how just because
  someone kisses you that doesn't mean she's your girlfriend, VICTOR. We also cover
  competitive female relationships, and how passion and talent don't always go together.
