date: 2017-10-05 12:30:00 -06:00
description: In this extra long episode of WTS Paul and Jan talk about The Little
  Prince. This movie is based on a book which was a beloved childhood favourite for
  Paul, so in this episode we talk about the relationship of the movie to the book.
  We also talk about why grown-ups are ridiculous, what it means to be essential,
  and why we wish this children’s movie had featured some more deaths.

We talk in this episode about adaptation theory, and Paul mentions Linda Hutcheon. You can find her book [on Google books here](https://books.google.ca/books?id=PRPReTQ2cYgC&lpg=PR3&pg=PR3#v=onepage&q&f=false) if you’d like to read more about that. If you’re interested in adaptation theory you might also want to check out the writings of Julia Kristeva (especially “Desire in Language”), Mikhail Bakhtin (especially “The Dialogic Imagination”), and Gerard Genette (especially “Palimpsests”). That ought to hold you.
