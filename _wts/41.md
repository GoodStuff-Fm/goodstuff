description: On this episode of WTS we’re talking about Despicable Me 2. That’s right,
  it was 3 last week and 2 this week. We’re doing this in backwards order. We talk
  about stereotypes as a villain's gimmick, the idea of macho, and why this movie
  missed an opportunity to explore how growing up is a kind of loss.
