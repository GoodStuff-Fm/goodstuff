description: "On this episode of WTS we’re talking about Despicable Me 2. That’s right, it was 3 last week and 2 this week. We’re doing this in backwards order. We talk about stereotypes as a villain's gimmick, the idea of macho, and why this movie missed an opportunity to explore how growing up is a kind of loss."
