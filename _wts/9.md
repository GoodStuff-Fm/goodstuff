We’d love to hear your thoughts about Walking with the Dinosaurs 3D. You definitely don’t need to have seen this movie to listen to this episode, but if you happen to have seen it, tell us why! We’d also love to hear your thoughts about any of the children’s movies we’ve talked about on Way Too Seriously. [Talk to us on Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/wtscast) and let us know what you think. Or shoot us an email at waytooseriouslycast at gmail.com if what you have to say will take more than 140 characters. You can also [discuss this episode in our subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Goodstuff_fm/).

Want to know what’s coming up at WTS? We’ve got [a schedule] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1f6fvTgbzQOCUD_potL6mWClmSC3D2cOBgKz36OwSC68/edit?usp=sharing) planned until September, and you can check it out!
