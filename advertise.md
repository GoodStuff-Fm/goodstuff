Goodstuff.fm's goal is to entertain and educate our listeners on a variety of topics.

We sell sponsorships on a run-of-network basis, which means your ad is featured on all of our shows for the length of your sponsorship. Your sponsorship will run for 28 days (4 weeks) from the first Monday it is approved.

If you don't already have your ad copy, we'll work with you on crafting the perfect sponsor read that matches the personality of Goodstuff with your company and specific ad campaign requirements.

## Sponsorships Typically Include:

* A brief mention during the introduction of the show.
* A 3-5 minute spot roughly in the middle of the show.
* Thanks at the end of the show
* A link in the episode page.
* Run-of-network sponsorships also receive a tweet at the beginning and end of each week from the [Goodstuff.fm Twitter account][1].
