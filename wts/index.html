            <p>In this extra long episode of WTS Paul and Jan talk about The Little Prince. This movie is based on a book which was a beloved childhood favourite for Paul, so in this episode we talk about the relationship of the movie to the book. We also talk about why grown-ups are ridiculous, what it means to be essential, and why we wish this children’s movie had featured some more deaths.</p>
