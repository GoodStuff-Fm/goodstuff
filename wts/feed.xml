    <title>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory: Oompa loompa doompa dee don’t</title>

    <pubDate>Fri, 12 Jan 2018 10:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[ On this episode we talk about Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. That’s the 2005 version with Freddie Highmore as Charlie, not the 1971 one with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka, which isn’t called Charlie and the Chocolate Factory at all, it’s called Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory so there really shouldn’t be any confusion. In this episode we talk about supporting art made by bad people, about whether Oompa Loompas are redeemable, and about why candy is only bad if you are fat.

    <title>The Nightmare Before Christmas: Agree to Disagree</title>
    <link>https://goodstuff.fm/wts/26</link>
    <pubDate>Fri, 01 Dec 2017 10:00:00 -0600</pubDate>
    <description><![CDATA[ In this episode of Way Too Seriously we’re talking about The Nightmare Before Christmas. Jan and Paul don’t quite see eye to eye about this movie. We disagree about whether this is a Halloween movie or a Christmas movie, whether Oogie Boogie is troublingly racialized, and whether Sally is a protagonist or a flat support character.

    <p>In this episode of Way Too Seriously, Jan and Paul talk about Megamind. We express our sympathy with Dreamworks for always being the runner-up, this time to Despicable Me. We also talk about why Roxie is a love interest for every male character in the movie, whether the fact that Megamind is blue makes him count as a person of colour, and Brad Pitt and the nature of privilege.</p>
