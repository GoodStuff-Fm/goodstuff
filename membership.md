# Choose How You'd Like to Support Goodstuff

There's two things you need to decide when you're becoming a Goodstuff member:

1) Support the entire network or a specific show.

* You can support the **entire network** and your funds will be shared among everyone
* Or pick a **specific show** and 70% (TBC) of your support will go to that show and 30% will go to support the network.

2) Annual or Monthly

You have the option of becoming a monthly member or an annual member. Both options will automatically renew until you decide to stop.
