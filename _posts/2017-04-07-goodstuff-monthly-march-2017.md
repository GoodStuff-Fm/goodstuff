As part of [our relaunch](https://goodstuff.fm/2017/03/11/goodstuff-v3/) we thought we'd be a little more public with things podcasters often tend to be a little shy about sharing: numbers and stats.

At the start of each month we'll tell you how Goodstuff is doing - number of patrons, listeners, site visitors, and anything else you'd like to know.

(*A little fine print: We're not going to be obsessively re-checking these numbers so forgive us if we they don't always balance exactly. We're podcasters, not accountants!*)

# Numbers for March, 2017

## Expenses for the Month
* $55 for web and file hosting

*We have other expenses (domain name, occasional gear/software licenses, etc.) but for the purposes of these posts we're just tracking our ongoing monthly expenses.*

## Patreon Campaigns
* [Goodstuff](https://www.patreon.com/goodstuff) - not currently active. Coming soon!
* [3 Guys 3 Questions](https://www.patreon.com/3g3q) - 15 patrons, $45 per month
* [iChris](https://www.patreon.com/ichris) - 20 patrons, $95 per month
* [Morning Show](https://www.patreon.com/morningshow) - shut down for now.

Currently $140/month income via patron support.

## Site Stats
* We borked our analytics code by mistake so data is missing from March.
* In the past: top traffic sources: [atu2.com](http://atu2.com), direct, organic search

## Feed Stats
* 11,118 subscribers to all shows
* [atU2](/atu2/) holds the top spot for most subscribers
