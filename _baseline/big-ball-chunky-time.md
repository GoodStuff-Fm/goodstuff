Andrew did an exercise. He's sore. We discuss. And try to tie it to baseball. It kind of works.

The flip-flop Kyle mentions is from... [this](https://twitter.com/missionsmilb/status/1107782483213312001). Uh, yeah.

Then, finally, we get to [**_BIG BALL CHUNKY TIME!_**](https://twitter.com/jason_koebler/status/1107241569864683522?s=12 "https://twitter.com/jason_koebler/status/1107241569864683522?s=12") Maybe sure you celebrate in the traditional way.

# Follow Up

Kyle watched the Reds @ Dodgers game on Pi Day. There was only one audio stream. It was just crowd noise. Kind of wild. Kyle [recorded some of it.](https://www.dropbox.com/s/zlh440e5u2u19z2/Reds%20at%20Dodgers%20Crowd%20Noise%202019-03-14.mp3?dl=0)

Then Kyle watched a game on St. Patrick's Day. MLB goes _all out_ for St. Patty's. Lots of green. It was... confusing. Then, we discuss Guinness.
