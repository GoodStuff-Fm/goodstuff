We talk about Opening Day, the results of our Twitter poll for the first film for Letterboxd Score, and ballpark food. Mostly ballpark food, to be honest.

# Followup

Opening Day happened, and baseball that counts feels _way_ different from Spring Training. Revenues are up! Lots of inside baseball talk.

### Letterboxd Score

Twitter has determined that we will be watching [_The Sandlot (1993)_](https://letterboxd.com/film/the-sandlot/) as the first movie. We'll be watching it... sometime. Also, James Earl Jones was in [_Click_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Click_(2006_film)). Also, there were three Sandlot films. We're definitely only gonna watch the first one. You're welcome for that knowledge.
