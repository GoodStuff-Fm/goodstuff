Welcome back to Baseline! We watched some Spring Training games!

We watched games using MLB.TV. It went pretty well. We watched the SF-CIN game, and only the SF side was televised, so Andrew had to watch that.

We discuss play-by-play announcers, then talk about wanting to personally play baseball.

In the **_SQUAT_**.

## Rookie Questions

* [Breaking ball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breaking_ball)
* [Changeup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeup)
* "3-2" curveballs
* [12-6 curveball](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/12–6_curveball)
* Inside/outside
