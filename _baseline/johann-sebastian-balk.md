# Giants News

[Derek Holland Blasts Giants Management, Says Team Had Him Fake An Injury](https://deadspin.com/derek-holland-blasts-giants-management-says-team-had-h-1834704011)

# Follow Up

We have received the following bingo square suggestions from an _unknown listener_:

1. Walk off home run
2. Double steal
3. Ground rule double
4. Suicide squeeze
5. Balk
6. Runner interference
7. Infield fly rule
8. Sacrifice fly

Some other ones we came up with during the show:

* You hear "popcorn" on the broadcast
* Someone doesnt catch the ball in foul ground
* Bat boy
* Player on first talks to the first baseman
* Game with fans on the field
* Organ music
* PA screwups

Further suggestions: bingo@baseline.show

# Minor League Team of the Week

There's a jingle this time! Thanks haroldina.

This week's team is the [Augusta GreenJackets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Augusta_GreenJackets), sent in by @theTiger. They're named for something related to a golf tournament. Go figure.
