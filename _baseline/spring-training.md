### Intro to Spring Training

Welcome back to Baseline! Spring Training is here! We discuss a bit.

It turns out:

* There's two spring training leagues, one in Florida and one in Arizona.
  * They're called the [Cactus League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training#Cactus_League) and the [Grapefruit League](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_training#Grapefruit_League).
* Teams in one league don't travel to play teams in the other.
* Spring training games don't matter.

The point of Spring Training is to GET YOLKED and prepare for baseball _that counts_.

[Here's why they go to other states.](https://www.accuweather.com/en/weather-news/why-mlb-teams-go-to-arizona-florida-for-spring-training/70004241)

[Here's the article Kyle referenced.](https://thebaseballcodes.com/2011/03/29/the-differences-between-spring-training-and-the-regular-season-sometimes-arent-so-different-after-all/)

### How to Watch/Listen to Spring Training Baseball (and Baseball In General)

Andrew was thwarted by MLB from listening to the first Reds spring training game, but this has been sorted out at press time.

Meanwhile, Kyle has the hookup from YouTube TV. But, it doesn't have radio broadcasts. So, [MLB At Bat](https://www.mlb.com/apps/atbat) is called for.

### Kyle's Game-Watching Experience

Kyle watched the Mariners play the Athletics in an airport bar. We break it down in considerable detail.

### How Baseball Scores Work

If you are somehow less familiar with baseball than Andrew, we go over how baseball scores (the _"box score"_) are reported, and what it all means.

We also discuss what the point of spring training is, and how it helps in determining starting lineups and rosters.

We decided to watch the upcoming (at time of recording) game between the Giants and the Reds and report back on the next episode. And we decided to set up an MLB.TV subscription.
