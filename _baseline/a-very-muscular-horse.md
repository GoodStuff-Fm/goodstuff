We wrap up spring training and look forward to Opening Day. #WholeSquadReady

We start by, uh, listening to some baseball (Reds vs. Braves). We describe what's happening. We also spend a not insignificant period of time discussing the safety equipment that baseball players (baseballmen?) wear.

Also discussed: [pine tar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pine_tar), [RBIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run_batted_in), [double switches](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_switch_(baseball)).

# We Did an Opening Day Stream

And you missed it. But you can watch it [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/402703838).

We talk about what we did (or didn't) do to prepare.

# Minor League Team of the Week

This week's team of the week is the [Louisville Bats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louisville_Bats).

That's the *Luhvull* Bats.

(Yes, Andrew called it the Major League Team of the Week. And Kyle called bats birds. We regret the errors.)

Then we have an idea for a video game where you play as a mascot. Mascot Simulator 2019. Get in touch if you want to license this idea.
