  </li>
</ul>

<p>When a woman speaks in a professional setting, she walks a tightrope. Either she’s barely heard or she’s judged as too aggressive. When a man says virtually the same thing, heads nod in appreciation for his fine idea. As a result, women often decide that saying less is more.</p>

</ul>

<p>I’m reading so, so much from women of colour on Twitter and my problems are nothing, my complaints infinitesimal in comparison. I am trying to support, to decenter myself in discussions and this is new territory for me to navigate as an opinion(ated) writer. I hate how much I use “I”. It’s always bothered me.</p>

    <p>Kari sits down with Todd Peters to talk about about his creative alternative adult life: SAHDing, not having a grand life-plan, being a self-taught professional musician, and balance in adult relationships. There’s a lot of laughing, which is normal for a conversation with Todd.</p>
