To manage your show and view episodes, you'll select the Collection with your show's name on the left (ex. 3G3Q). Here, you'll see a list of Documents, or Episodes, and Collection Settings.

If you'd like to access and manage your show more directly, you can bookmark the collection/show's URL in Siteleaf.

### Creating an Episode
To create a new episode, you'll click on **New document** on the top right of your show's collection. This will display a screen with all of the fields you need for your show to be posted.

You can also bookmark this page if you'd like to go directly to creating a new episode.

Once you have finished editing your episode, you must press the green **Save** button. This does not publish the episode. You will need to then press the **Publish Changes** button on the top right to publish your episode.

### Publishing an Episode
