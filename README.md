### Viewing Episodes
You'll land on the **Pages** screen: a list of all of the pages on Goodstuff.

To manage your show and view episodes, you'll select the Collection with your show's name on the left (ex. 3G3Q). Here, you'll see a list of Documents, or Episodes, and Collection Settings.

If you'd like to access and manage your show more directly, you can bookmark the collection/show's URL in Siteleaf.

### Creating an Episode
To create a new episode, you'll click on **New document** on the top right of your show's collection. This will display a screen with all of the fields you need for your show to be posted.

You can also bookmark this page if you'd like to go directly to creating a new episode.

Once you have finished editing your episode, you must press the green **Save** button. This does not publish the episode. You will need to then press the **Publish Changes** button on the top right to publish your episode.

### Publishing an Episode
Once you have finished adding and saving your latest episode, you will need to publish these changes to the site. This will cause the whole site to be rebuilt and published. Any additional changes will need to follow this same process.
