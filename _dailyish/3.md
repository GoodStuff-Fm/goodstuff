description: For episode 3 I commit to and use the Auphonic app to record for real
  this time. I&rsquo;m recording in my kitchen while making my coffee -can you smell
  the difference from my usual office recordings?   How would you listen to a short
  podcast like this? Direct link to mp3 on Twitter or traditional podcast player that
  download/streams the show. Let me know in the comments below.
