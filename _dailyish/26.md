[Time For a New Challenge — mykehurley.net](http://mykehurley.net/blog/time-for-a-new-challenge)


The last 18 months have been a tremendous experience, but it is time for me to move on to new things. I have new goals that I want to tackle, and to be able to do this I need to be independent again.

[Show Me Your Mic #2: Myke Hurley - Goodstuff FM](http://goodstuff.fm/smym/2)


Myke Hurley is my guest for episode 2. We talk single shows versus setting up a network, when is the right time to approach a sponsor, using the tools you have, future-proofing your gear purchases, conducting a great interview and of course - what podcasts Myke is listening to.

[Show Me Your Mic #22: Myke Hurley Round 2 - Goodstuff FM](http://goodstuff.fm/smym/22)


For episode 22 I have my first returning guest in Myke Hurley. Since he was on a previous episode we spend our conversation talking about post production, changing formats of a show, doing a nighttime talk show, deciding when a show is done. Stick around for the AAOO where we fall into soundboard wars.
