title: Talking Through an Idea
date: 2015-06-03 12:11:00 -06:00
description: Are you ever curious about how a podcast gets from idea to your eardrums?
  If so, this might be an episode for you. I recorded a chat with Sue as we debate
  a new show idea for Goodstuff that may (or may not) ever hit your ears in the future.
  But it&rsquo;s fun to document the process!
