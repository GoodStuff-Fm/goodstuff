As most people know by now, the CBC announced today that it is immediately cutting ties with Jian Ghomeshi, the host of the program Q. Those who are following along will also know that just after 6 p.m., Ghomeshi posted his version of events on Facebook.

There’s a scandal breaking in Canada. It’s about BDSM. Or is it? I’m not so sure.

Shortly after CBC announced Ghomeshi was out the door on Sunday, Ghomeshi released news that he was launching a $50-million lawsuit claiming “breach of confidence and bad faith” by his employer of almost 14 years. He later followed that up with a Facebook posting saying he has been the target of “harassment, vengeance and demonization.”

CBC has so far refused to say what that information actually is, but rumors online suggest that the radio star's firing was related to incidents of sexual harassment.
