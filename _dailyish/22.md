description: Bear with me as I run this little experiment. I had an idea to do a quick
  look at things I found interesting around the web on Tuesdays and Thursdays -my
  usual podcasting days -and record it in the Daily(ish) feed. Like it? Hate it?  [Email
  me](mailto:chris@goodstuff.fm) or hit me up on  [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iChris)
  with your thoughts.
