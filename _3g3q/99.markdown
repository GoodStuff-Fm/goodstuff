title: 3G3Q Template and the Really Long Title that Might Never End, But Eventually
  it Might End Because I Made it Too Long
date: 2016-04-01 12:11:00 -06:00
position: 1
description: Suppose that communal kitchen years to come perhaps. All trotting down
  with porringers and tommycans to be filled. Devour contents in the street. John
  Howard Parnell example the provost of Trinity every mother’s son don’t talk of your
  provosts and provost of Trinity women and children cabmen priests parsons fieldmarshals
  archbishops. From Ailesbury road, Clyde road, artisans’ dwellings, north Dublin
  union, lord mayor in his gingerbread coach, old queen in a bathchair. My plate’s
  empty. After you with our incorporated drinkingcup. Like sir Philip Crampton’s fountain.
  Rub off the microbes with your handkerchief. Next chap rubs on a new batch with
  his. Father O’Flynn would make hares of them all. Have rows all the same. All for
  number one. Children fighting for the scrapings of the pot. Want a souppot as big
  as the Phoenix park. Harpooning flitches and hindquarters out of it. Hate people
  all round you. City Arms hotel table d’hôte she called it. Soup, joint and sweet.
  Never know whose thoughts you’re chewing. Then who’d wash up all the plates and
  forks? Might be all feeding on tabloids that time. Teeth getting worse and worse.
