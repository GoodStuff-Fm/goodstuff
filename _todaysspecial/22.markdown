description: Located in the seedy underbelly of Bangkok, the Raisin and Spice Bar
  is home to some of the roughest and most dangerous criminals on Earth. Sebastian
  Heller is among the strongest of the bunch, and he doesn't let anyone pass without
  first feeling the burning wrath of a Super-Street-Fighter-2 style Tiger Uppercut.
  Sing-Song McCracken forges the path behind with his signature Karate-Kid-3 style
  flippy kick. Thomas "The Tank" Engine will downright steamroll his foes without
  so much as a glance. Fortunately for you, New York Times reporter Laura Ghuitarre
  has made her way in to this closed community of killers. You can hear the grimy
  tales of destruction and mayhem straight from the source today. Can you stomach
  the sinister force of the Raisin and Spice Bar?
