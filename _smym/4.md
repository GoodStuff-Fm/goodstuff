description: Darren Moser of The Dr. Sci-Fi podcast is my guest on episode 4. He has
  an interesting setup of hardware, software and services to get his podcast recorded
  - including an AI co-host. He&rsquo;s only a few episodes in to his podcast, but
  he&rsquo;s done a lot of thinking about the how and why of his podcast.
