description: It would be hard to overstate how much of an influence Merlin Mann has
  had on my online escapades. From the way I blog on my weblog, toot on my Twitter
  or tumble on my tumblr. You get the idea. This was 5 parts therapy, 8 parts fun
  and 10 parts nervous, giddy laughter (on my part). A total of 23 parts. Or a “full
  Merlin” as I like to call it. So fun.
