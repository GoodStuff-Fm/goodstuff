title: Ray Ortega - Switching Mics On the Fly
date: 2014-12-23 12:11:00 -06:00
description: Ray Ortega is the last guest for 2014 on Show Me Your Mic and we had
  a great chat about podcasting as a career, starting a YouTube channel, streaming
  live video and the mic that&rsquo;s very likely better than the Heil PR40 for podcasting.
