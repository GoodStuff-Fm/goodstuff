description: Dan Benjamin is one of the folks that really inspired me to get into
  podcasting and so it’s an honor to have him on this show. We run the gamut of podcasting
  from his start on the Hivelogic podcast to where he is now, networks vs individual
  podcasts, getting unstuck when podcasting, taking care of sponsors and plenty of
  fun discussion on life as a podcaster.
