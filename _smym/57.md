Episode № 57
Ham Radio and Podcasting - The Scope Show


November 4th, 2014
·
54
minutes


Jared and Shane, two of the hosts of The Scope Show, are the guests on this week’s SMYM. They’ve been recording The Scope Show since 2006 - which is a long time in podcast years. We talk about the benefits of recording in the same room as your co-hosts, using YouTube and other platforms for promotion and of course geek out on gear.
