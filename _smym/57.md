date: 2014-11-04 12:11:00 -06:00
description: Jared and Shane, two of the hosts of The Scope Show, are the guests on
  this week’s SMYM. They’ve been recording The Scope Show since 2006 - which is a
  long time in podcast years. We talk about the benefits of recording in the same
  room as your co-hosts, using YouTube and other platforms for promotion and of course
  geek out on gear.
