description: For episode 5 I&rsquo;m joined by J.D. Andrew and Brady Goodman of The
  WAV Files podcast. Brady is a recovering radio DJ and J.D. is an audio engineer
  so we had lots to talk about including moving from radio to podcasting, how content
  is the most important thing to your podcast, advertising your podcast on Facebook,
  using Google+ to promote your podcast, and advice for new podcasters. Oh and we
  also got to hear the story of J.D.&rsquo;s infamous encounter with Jian Ghomeshi
  on Q as part of The Boxmasters.
