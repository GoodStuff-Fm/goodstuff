description: What's going to happen if the walled garden closes in around podcasting?
  And what do Chris and Kyle think about sponsorship, getting sponsors, and making
  money at podcasting. They also discuss Rogue Amoeba's update to Audio Hijack and
  how it might help podcasters.
sponsor: "[Mimo Live](https://boinx.com/mimolive/): Video streaming and production
  provided by Mimo Live. Learning how to use mimoLive is child's play – literally.
  Its logical and intuitive production workflow can be mastered by anyone from school
  kids to senior citizens in very short time. And yet it is so powerful, it also satisfies
  the broadcasting veterans wildest dreams."
