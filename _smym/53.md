In this first episode, Ashley and Paddy introduce the Working Out podcast and what it's about, touching upon where they're both currently at in developing their passion-based businesses, and where they ultimately want to be.

Using the 5 Whys technique, an initially skeptical Paddy finds out that his original goal of 'cutting out client work' isn't really his goal at all. This week on the show, Ashley and Paddy embark on a journey of self-discovery to get to the root of why they're doing what they're doing.

Do you know 'what' you're passionate about? Sometimes it's not so easy to pick out a theme that ties all your various passions together. What if you aren't passionate about anything at all? Following up on last week's 'why' discussion, Ashley and Paddy discuss how flexibility is key when setting up a business doing what you love.

The Day Job. It's one of the huge barriers between you and setting up your dream business. Not a decision to be taken lightly, but leaving the 'security' of a day job for a chance at setting up a passion based business is a big step in the process.

[#22: The Importance Of Having A Personal Brand | Working Out Podcast](http://workingoutpodcast.com/2014/10/01/22-the-importance-of-having-a-personal-brand.html)


Everything you put out there contributes in some way to how people think of you as a professional. Every tweet, Facebook status, Instagram and email. Everything. People like to deal with people, so ask yourself why would a potential client choose you over someone else with your exact skills?
