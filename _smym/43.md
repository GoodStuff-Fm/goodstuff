Huffduffer is a great service for podcasters and it happens to be built by one guy - Jeremy Keith. Listeners of SSKTN will know that I, Chris Enns, am a big fan of Huffduffer so I wanted to have Jeremy on to chat about Huffduffer. We talked about where the idea came from, the nerdy origins of the name and ways to help your podcast look better when it gets Huffduff'd.
